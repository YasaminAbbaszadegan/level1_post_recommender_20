1,Share your Goal ,30-Day Challenge,427,9.4k,"Much of success is knowing what you want to achieve. Share your goal with the Codecademy Community here!Well, might as well go first
I’m a homeschooled, teen, programmer who has been using codecademy for many years to help me learn. This year was different though. This school year, I’m going to be reviewing front-end web development (taking the web development Pro path) and hoping to get an actual internship at a company in the summer.
This is a big step up for me because I have never done any coding professionally, so I’m hoping that I’ll have the skills required for the job I want to do. If anyone has any advice for me, I’d be glad to hear it.
So that’s my goal. Acquire the skills to get an actual internship in the summer.Despite Christmas and moving to a new home, I will try to repeat what I have already learned -10 min/day…- so as not to forget everything… Have a full time job not connected to coding, but still can be a good advantage.
So my goal is to complete the Web Development Path and really get how it all works My goal will be to increase what I normally do, so have at least 30min of practice a day, and 30min of studying a day.I started learning Javascript by attending a workshop.  I found it challenging so I decided to do the Introduction to Javascript course.  I was about half way through and then stopped.  So I want to complete the course over the 30 days.I’ve started my coding journey 8 months ago and now I feel confident enough to take the training wheels off and start coding from scratch thanks to Codecademy.  As for monthly goals I have recently taken time off my regular job to fast track my coding journey. this week I’m learning the  Java programming language. Next week I will learn all the libraries and frameworks associated with java (spring,hibernate,spring boot). By the end of the month my goal is to set up my portfolio site with all my projects attached and start applying to jobs.I have started to like Codecademy and recently became a pro member… My goal is to learn Python and do at least 10-15 minutes of coding everyday. Wish me luck guys!I joined Codecademy earlier this year and haven’t made it a priority to use.  I’m hoping this challenge will get me in the habit of learning every day.  I’m learning this for work and furthering the career I have as a sys admin.  Wish me luck too!  I’m a 6yo full-stack PHP developer and I want to deep dive into React/Vue frameworks, building 1 project (small or big) per each. I must do it to stay young, they say.Started the Data Science path at Codecademy a couple months ago. My goal now is to accelerate the learning of Python, every day. Best wishes to all! This first week was important to me. If you start off/finish this week wrong, it will determine how you will view the rest of time you spend coding.

10-10-10 Rule: A Motivating Thought Exercise Will what you are learning matter to you in 10 minutes? 10 days? 10 years?


This is a question you must ask yourself? Will I keep on using this? Or am I just learning it to say “I learned how to do this… once” Make sure that you are learning something that can be used again and again. For me, this past week, I was working on the basis of some HTML & CSS. I kept thinking to myself “I know all this stuff already… am I wasting my time?” and I could always answer myself, “The basics are the basis to all knowledge.” You may, like me, want something more advanced but you have to start off slow. It’s just like running. If you go from not running at all to running four miles a day, it’s not gonna help and it’s just gonna discourage and hurt you.
Currently, I have a friend who is learning to code and he’s just getting started. One thing you can say to someone who is just starting out or struggling is to remind him that once you learn this stuff and practice it, you’ll know it forever. You’ll never forget how to make an onclick function, write data to files using Python, or pull database info using SQL. And you’ll be able to use the concepts to help you learn and do even more. All you gotta do is get over this hurdle, learn how to do this one concept, and as long as you use it and practice it, you’ll never forget it.
Why? Why am I learning something new? This question could be finished in many ways. A couple such as “I already know enough to do this project” or “What’s even the point?”. This question floats around my head when I’m struggling to learn something new. My answer to this is that it’s because even if I know how to do this in a different way or language, maybe that’s not the most efficient way of doing this. Maybe if I use this way, it will be more readable, faster, or it just works better. That’s why I’m learning this. I’m taking this course because I want to advance my knowledge. I don’t want to just be a bump on a long which only knows a certain amount and only does anything this one way. I want to be able to fix the problem in a couple of different ways so I can see which one is the best way of doing it.
Celebrating small wins is important. Those small wins are the wins that are gonna get you up to that final big win. Always take time to rejoice when you fix a bug, learn a new concept, or finish that one really hard lesson, no matter how small and insignificant it seems. This will not only encourage you, but it will make you so much more eager to get at that next lesson or bug. I know that whenever I finish a Codecademy Project, I usually put it in a Github Repository and then send it to my friends with a message similar to “Programming is so much fun! Look what I made!” Maybe it’s just that I have an amazing group of friends, but they are always like “That’s so cool!”, “I really love how this works”, “How long did it take you to make this? It’s really good!”, and it just makes me super happy.
I’ll give you one piece of overall advice for programming in general. Have other people. Make sure there is someone out there who you can rely on. There’s always someone who you’re friends with who will be happy to look at what you’re working on and encourage you as long as you do the same back to them. You can even just have someone online (on the Codecademy Discord Server 15 for example) who you can send a weekly update on chat and they’ll encourage you, and they’ll send you their stuff and you can critique and complement as well.I’m pretty new to coding in general, so my main objective is just learning a solid base. Specific to that objective, I would like to:

Finish Intro to HTML
Finish Intro to CSS
Finish Intro to JavaScript
Build out a web project using those learnings
Hello, my name is Diana Maria and I have started my programming challenge for 30 days. I learned some things but most of them I have really forgotten and what I most want is to learn to program well. So here I start my own learning process.My goal is to learn JS and after moving to Python so i would be able to start my hacking learning trip
it’s simply : finishing the goal i just mentionned and after beggining with the Family+ and studying about some certificates like Comptia and CEH , Cissco …etc
i need so much focus tho .
I wish ,you all would achieve your goals , always believe in yourselves and that God is with you ^-^
console.log(""Have a nice day );Primary Goal - My goal is to practice Javascript through CA tutorials for a minimum of 30 minutes every day. By the end of the 30 days, I aim to have a better solid foundation in the theoretical basics than I do currently.
Secondary Goal - will be to have applied this theory I’ve learned to 1 project - whether it be good or terrible quality.My goal in the next 30 days is to complete the Web Development Course 
Brushing up on old favorites like HTML and CSS has been a huge help in boosting my confidence as I move into JavaScript! At the end of the challenge, I’d love to take these new skills and start working on creative web-projects Almost at 30 days.  How’d it go?Hi! My goal for the next 30days is to complete all Web Development Carrer Path, which it isn’t impossible since I’ve done lots of Courses and the Learn How to Build Websites Skill Path. I’m sure I’ll have a lot of work tho. XD
Hope everyone achieve your goals! Good luck!"
2,What was your win this week?,Random,3,17,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not!

Did you start a new course and make progress?
Did you attend a virtual meetup?
Did you start a coding streak?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins!  Coding-related: I finished the Files module on the DS path and started the medical insurance portfolio project. (though, went a different way and used pandas, numpy, scipy and seaborn to analyze the data).
I can’t think of anything non-coding related. 
Well, unless you count me writing out Christmas cards and mailing them.  What was my win? WHAT WAS MY WIN?!


Open at your own risk.
A WHOLE TRAILER FOR THE LOKI SHOW WAS RELEASED. I was expecting to get some pictures of Tom Hiddleston on set, and instead we got A WHOLE FREAKING TRAILER?! AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO TO SLEEP? (LOKI’S SMALL HORNS HELMET HELP ME I CAN’T BREATHE AND THEN WHEN HE TURNED INTO TOM HIDDLESTON I MEAN HE IS TOM HIDDLESTON BUT HIS SHORT HAIR OMG I CAN’T).
It felt like my cheeks were about to explode of how much I smiled (and screamed)   
I don’t think I’ve ever been this excited IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
Then I went to sleep (kinda) because I couldn’t take so much excitement, and today I find ALL THESE NEW DISNEY AND MARVEL ANNOUNCEMENTS?! AND THE NEW WANDAVISION AND THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER TRAILERS?! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HANDLE ALL OF THIS?!?!?!    
I AM NOT SORRY FOR MY ENTHUSIASM (but maybe for the caps…I am sorry for all the caps.)

Oh and I made some progress with the Computer Science path, and took some notes about an IoT course I’m taking.I had a pretty fun week. I made stable progress on the Full Stack path and the Data science path. I hosted this week’s focus session and met a couple of new faces this time which was fun! I also started with Intro to Phaser.JS course on Codecademy.
I watched the first episode of season 4 of Attack on Titans and I’ve say to say I was impressed with it. And also sad because Haikyuu S4 will end soon.
Overall, a stable week with a lot of learning."

Hey guys and gals!
I’m a Computer & Network security student, but am also studying to (hopefully) be part of a Coding school right here in the little state of Delaware! Our very first coding school has me revved up for coding.  I always wanted to learn, especially as I learned more about cyber security I learned that coding is essential not only for understanding issues, but in creating solutions. In addition to this though, our area is booming for software developers - and the more I learn coding, the more I realize just how much I love it.  I’m an older student, as I have actually been in customer service for years and have also been a published author - but thanks to school and getting some great advice from my college advisor, my career went down a different path that utilized my skills more accurately. I have one degree already and am working on my second one. I hope to be able to give advice on here one day to others as I learn and go along myself (especially while the lessons are still fresh in my mind). Thank you to all the teachers, contributors, and other classmates who help us newbs get through these lessons together!  Take care!
CindyHi!  I’m Amber !
A little about me… I’m 21 female… a complete nerd, I recently found out I have Asperger’s syndrome…
I’m looking to learn coding to improve my my skill set, cause let’s be honest that’s the only reason I’m gonna get hired, I’m currently in a 5-6 month class that focuses on business skills. Mostly that means a lot of basic computer skills. Well, I know all Microsoft office 2010, so I’ll be on here while everyone else is learning how to format a word document. However, I will be the one that has to have the manner class and “how to not cry in front of your boss” and “how to not to go into too much detail in your first post.”Hey everyone!
I’m Joah. I’m 18 years old, and I’m a native Texan. I work as a Software Engineer at AmeriCommerce. For my job, I basically do JS-fu wherever it’s needed. I’ve been a part of the Codecademy community for ~3 years, and a forums moderator for ~2.5. I am fluent in HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, and Zsh.I’m Zeke Y, age 15, and homeschooled. I’ve been an enthusiastic user of Codecademy for a while now, ever since late 2013 I think 
I like working with Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, but I’m hoping to learn Python Django and ReactJS someday. My current main projects are school and Codecademy Redesigned, a Chrome/Firefox extension that redesigns the Q&A forums on Codecademy and adds several new features into or back into Codecademy.Hey, I’m Tony, probably the oldest guy in town so I will not tell you my age.

Why I love codecademy? You can always get a good laugh. 286Hello,
Roy, here. I won’t tell you my age, either, but only admit to having four grand children. My energy here has been focused upon helping new learners get over the hurdles. Even though I have no formal training, personal projects and helping others has given me a fairly good understanding of core concepts. My biggest weakness is verbosity. Answers tend to be tl dr, though it follows my desire to give some take away.At least you kept your good looks!Hi my name is chris.
January 2014, I retired from the Army after 20 years of service.  My job in the army was a communications chief.  I was responsible for planning, setting up and maintaining all of the radio, wire and automation for the unit.  I have been working on computers, networks and servers for over 20 years.  My first few jobs after the Army were a system administrator job for Healthcare.gov 2, backup engineer position for the US Air Force and most recently a senior training specialist for the US Army.  We recently moved to Middleton, ID where I am working as a systems analyst which involves modifying and writing SQL scripts for various SQL DB servers as well as other Sys Admin functions.
I joined Codeacademy a few years ago but I have not taken full advantage of what is offered here.  Recently I started the Java lesson to refresh myself on syntax and the like in preparation for a Android programming class I took.  And now I am starting the SQL class to get myself some of the basics.
thanksHelluw !
I’ll introduce myself to you…  . My name is Lars Carré, I’m a 16 year old student who lives Belgium.
I don’t have a job, but I will soon enough after College  . I’m really interested in Programming and therefore I’m trying to finish courses on Code Academy. I’m still learning everyday, which explains my profile picture, as I am still a work in progress… I hope to become a good programmer one day… I really can’t wait to learn more and more! As I’m currently working with Python and soon start Java for school.
I haven’t been able to use it yet. Luckily I know some basics of CSS and HTML in which I’ve supported a lot of friends by making websites and my Grandma’s website for charity: Vale Viver 135.
I’d like to share with you that I love the community and I’d like to say: Keep up the good work!
Thanks for these awe-inspired courses 
Keep coding!
Cheers, Lars.My name is Chris, I’m 19 as I update this post and live in the British Isles.  I have been around on Codecademy since August 5th 2014 and I was a Moderator from 31st Jan 2017 to 31st July 2020.> Hello Friends!

hi am oye am a maketing student but i have a strong love for software and anything technologyHello, My name is Wil. I was told about this website by my brother who has been learning here for a while now.  I saw him developing a web page one day and asked where he learned how to do it.  I am very interested in marketing/web design.  While I have the marketing skills, everything in the marketing world is going digital and that is what I am lacking.  So here I am, trying to figure it all out.  I have completed the HTML section and now I’m on to Java.  I will probably learn everything here by the time I’m done.  I am so glad this site exists because with my current job I can’t actually go to a class, so this is perfect!  Thanks Code Academy!Hey guys, it’s cool to be able to talk to you guys finally instead of just checking code. All that seemed just a little too official and it’s nice to be able to see who the real “you” is.
My name is Alex, and am currently serving in the armed forces at the age of 21. It’s nice to be able to code again, but I started off on Visual Basic 6, and the C languages. (I can’t wait to get to Java!). I joined codecademy when my programming teacher suggested it when I was back in high school, he actually changed my course for the school year to JavaScript back when it was still a little less refined. So I spent almost three months just learning JavaScript and gave him a report on the site, and what I thought of it in it’s early stages.
For a brand new site, codecademy was an amazing concept that I had never seen before, I was excited and couldn’t wait to work more on it. I dropped out from 2013-2015(about a month ago) It’s so much different from the early days that I first saw available with only two or three languages at most. I can’t wait to catch up and learn more from not only the site, but from all of you guys!
–EDIT–
I JUST HIT MY 31 DAY STREAK!  so excited!Hello! I am Fynnthedestroyer

4,A completed course appears as “In Progress”,Bug Reporting,7,49,"Hi everyone.
I was looking through my courses overview and I found the Learn SQL course, which I completed like a year ago, marked as “In Progress…”:
sql-course-error1920×988 62 KB

If I click on it, it says I completed it:
sql-course-error-21920×946 55 KB

It doesn't really bother me, but I just thought I'd report the error.Did they possibly add anything new to it?
I had some completed courses from over a year ago but when I click on some lessons they’re not completed bc of the new material.
I take back what I said (b/c I was on mobile when I replied earlier).
I looked at one of the course–Analyze Data With Python–I’d completed a couple years ago and it says it’s not completed. I drilled down into each part of the syllabus and each has a checkmark but says “resume” on it. Nothing is incomplete. I’ll submit a bug report on this.
Did you submit a bug report too?


 lisalisaj:

Did you submit a bug report too?


Heh, to be honest idk how 
Mind helping me out?Did you go through each lesson on those courses to verify that they were in fact completed? I checked two of my courses & one was complete while another had new material that I’d not done yet.

5,"AI Ethics, Dr. Timnit Gebru & Google",Random,2,44,"This is pretty important if you’re in ML, AI, NLP & Data Science. More importantly, this is concerning if you’re interested in AI ethics, or, ethics at all as well as censorship.

7,I hit the 60 day mark!,Random,6,81,"I made it to 60 days!
I’ve completed 61% of the Learn Python 3 course 1.
I’ve completed 89% of the Build Chatbots With Python course 2.
I plan to keep doing this, so I’ll give you an update on 90 days! Keep it up well done!

A river cuts through rock not because of it’s power, but because of it’s persistence
well done! that’s a huge achievement.Holy! That’s super cool. Keep going.YEA!!!  
That’s excellent! Keep going! Congrats, 60 days is very hard to do! Good work. Hopefully you’re still moving forward, learning all that you can! "
8,What are the anime that the community is watching this week?,Random,3,66,"Hello, anime viewers and manga readers.
Did you start watching any new anime or reading a new manga that piqued your interest this week?
Personally, I’ve binged Dr. Stone and Attack on Titans in the past week since they’re returning with new seasons from January 2021 and December 2020 respectively.
What is the anime that you’ve picked up this week?
An anime suggestion from me would be ‘Jujutsu Kaisen’.I second Jujutsu Kaisen! So far, the plot is looking really good! I love the characters too.I personally really enjoy Danganronpa, I definitely recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed ATOT, since you’d probably be used to Gorey topics and blood.Yeah, @r3v3rb totally. The new season of Shingeki no Kyojin looks sick even though I was scared that Mappa might not be able to do a good job. xD
Personally, I was very happy with the first episode this week(Only felt that the CGI on beast titan was looking weird.)
I’m looking forward to this season. Plus next year’s full of exciting anime returning like Dr. Stone: Stone wars and The promised Neverland season 2 and also Rezero returning for the second half of the season. So, I’m really looking forward to all of these."
9,Getting Started On This 30-Day Challenge! What is your purpose?,30-Day Challenge,28,546,"Hi guys,
Currently on Day 2 of this 30-day challenge and have chosen to pursue the computer science path! I have always believed that people don’t burnout, they just forget their purpose. For this reason, I wanted to ask you why you chose your skill/path for this 30-day challenge?
I have been wanting to learn to code for some time now and chose to go with python as it is a very versatile language.
Whether you have completed this challenge, or missed a day of coding, I wanted to share with you this quote 
“Success is not final, Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.” - Winston Churchill
Cheers!Good luck with your challenge! I’ve heard from pretty much everybody I’ve asked that consistency is key. It’s okay if you only have 10 minutes one day. The importance part is to make the effort to come back every time. Good luck!I’m one of those people who can reallllllly get addicted to keeping a streak going. I’m on Day 13 and I do not want to drop the ball. I like the way the lessons are set up so you can complete a unit, take the quiz and stop for the day. I also paid for the pro version, so I promised myself I would really make an effort to make the most of it. I’ve started the program on free mode way too many times - this is the longest I’ve gone so far. I did the basic intro path, and now I’m doing the webpage design path.Best of luck! I also got the Pro version to make a hard commitment lol We have something in common then, I enjoy getting the streak going as long as I can.
Sadly I lost my last one by a couple hours. I am know working on building it back up.
I think it is very helpful if you are trying to work on a course.Hey! I’m on Day 3 of this challenge. I’ve started with computer science as well. Hoping to learn good level skills! I’m on Day 15 now with the Web Development path…
Hoping to eventually start a new career with my newfound knowledge!
Was slow at first but trying to pick up the pace a bit. Just started with the Javascript chapter…I’m on day 3 of the challenge and am doing Web Development. I’m on the pro trial version at the moment and am loving it. I think your theory is fantastic and its a great quote. Keep going everyone!That’s the spirit, goodluck! Great job, keep it up! Thank you, I appreciate it! Goodluck to you too! Currently on a 14 day streak with Python.
40% complete.I have been doing python coding for a few years and I think I know the basics, but it’s never too late to refresh your memory and learn some new things, so I have decided it would be a good idea to do the 30 day challenge and in the challenge my goal is to finish the Python 2 course.12 day streak, finished 2 courses and 55% of a different 10 week course.
Never knew I would like coding, hmm. Im so glad im 80 percent DONE!Dont bother with pro you can get all the info for free somewhere elseI like the lessons, and quizzes and I absolutely love the coding challenges. But, the projects can make me lose motivation because it seems that most of the effort goes into figuring out what they are asking me to do. Some days I can’t even get myself to push through a single step on the projects. On those days I do practice quizzes for something way easier. That way I continue my streak. I just got to 31 days! I plan to keep it going for 100!Hi @eulergroupie314 ,
I went through a stage like that in the beginning of the CS course (first few projects). Keep in mind that you don’t have to remember everything as a programmer!
If you are being asked to do a specific step, make sure to use the cheatsheets, the information from the lectures, and even google (for these projects tho, you are given all the info you need)! Once you’re done with the course, you will be using stackoverflow as your cheatsheet! 
At the beginning I was always trying to do these projects based on my memory and would get very frustrated and discouraged as well. In no time, you will be thinking like a programmer and tackling all these projects.
Lastly, you should know there is no specific answer to a project! What I mean by this is that there are many ways to solve a problem and will not always match the code structure given. As long as you’ve tested your code and works for all scenarios, you’ve done it!
Cheers!I had a streak for about a week but I have to take a break one or two days because learning JavaScript is just so hard it get’s me down and I feel terrible. I’ve repeated the Intro to JavaScript course at least 3 times and I still can’t remember anything more than some random code. It’s very hard to understand what the instructions actually want me to do sometimes but I also can’t do anything without instructions or the hints in the lessons.  It’s so hard to have motivation to learn something when it’s so difficult but I have to do it to stay employable It’s ok to feel that way. You should consider taking the course on coursera about “Biohacking Your Brain’s Health” and also reading Jim Kwik’s book “Limitless”.
Those are some very powerful resources on learning. They’ve helped me so much throughout my learning experience. Let me know if it helps! "
10,Use Python to Automate simple Tasks,Tips and Resources,1,28,"Hi,
I just finished the Python 3 and the Data Science Course on Codecademy.
I love Python and i want to try to automate some simple Tasks (create a Folder, Upload a file to a Website, copy from a file…).
Right now I use CodeCademy and Jupyter Notebooks. Can you point me in an direction for further learning to automate?
Thank you for all Tipps and Resources!@corecoder49759,
Have you checked out Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 2?  It’s an excellent book on how to get started automating all sorts of different things.  Some of it might be material you already know since it goes over a quick recap of the Python language basics in the first few chapters, but there’s still plenty to learn from this book.
Also, if you’re mostly using Jupyter notebooks to write and run your code, I’d suggest you get comfortable with writing in an editor (such as VS Code, etc.) and running those scripts from the command line.
Good luck, and happy coding!"
11,Any Pharmacist here?,30-Day Challenge,1,19,"Hello community,
I graduated from Pharmacy last year with no programming background . I worked for 1 year in a retail pharmacy’s ecommerce department as head of ecommerce & advanced customer service. We were selling vitamin and beauty products online , not medicines of course.
There i realized that if I have programming knowledge, lots of things can be automated.
I’m learning Python for 20 days now.  This night I finished Python 3 course. It’s not that hard if I compare the things I was studying.
Today I’m starting the 30-day challenge to improve my skills further.
Is there anyone whose major is healthcare?
What’s your motivation to learn programming?
Have a nice day.HI, I don’t have any experience in pharmacy, but I do have experience in coding, good luck! "

I only took 1 semester of python, and now I’m on the Data Science Path after advice from my advisor. If you see this, definitely share your progress!"
14,When you realize the 30-day challenge doesn’t have to be a 30 day streak,30-Day Challenge,12,467,"I accidentally lost my coding streak because I spent a whole day trying to solve a problem in the Roller Coaster assignment. I was coding with VScode so I didn’t trigger anything that allows Codecademy to know I was progressing. Then I realized at least the 30-day challenge doesn’t need to be a streak. I’m still a little bit bummed that I lost my streak though. 
Annotation 2020-06-29 1107541214×683 68.7 KBIt’s ok!! The challenge is more symbolic than anything. The fact that your following through is the real reward.Wait what! I thought the 30 day challenge was a streak. It doesn’t have to be. Thanks for that piece of information, I just started the streak so…I mean, to the computer it has to be (it won’t track it if you break a day).
But the human goal of the streak is the consistency, so 29/30 is still 30 in my book. (Life happens, after all )Wait what!!!  i thought it had to be a streak or it would restarttl:dr; learn when you want to learn and not when some system tells you to.
Personally I wish companies would do away with the streaks but luckily it’s easy to ignore. I find it to be quite annoying and de-motivating so probably does the opposite of what I’m guessing they’re meant to do.
Learning should be something you actively want to do otherwise it becomes a chore. If you only learn to continue the streak then you’re learning just to satisfy the streak and that’s not where your motivation should come from and you end up not learning for your own sake and personal development. Your motivation should come from something personal and something you want to attain in the future, like a new career or even just to learn a new skill.
Take Duolingo for example, a popular language learning tool, on some days I wouldn’t feel like learning but the app just keeps pestering you to learn something to keep the streak going and then it would make you feel bad if you lost your streak. Some days I would just log in do the simplest lesson just to continue the streak and then log off. My motivation for the app dwindled and I didn’t really feel like using it.
But I got into the mindset that I will learn at my own pace and not when the app wants me to learn and after not caring about the streak, I enjoyed it more and probably used it for a longer period of time per session.
Obviously this doesn’t apply to everyone and if the streak system works for you, great.I agree with @munroe4985 that the streak is annoying, i learn reguarly but there was one day i only found time after 00:00 and my long streak ended abrupty.
It doesn’t matter.  Just keep going Yeah I agree, now I wish there’s an option to hide the streak.I get that you’re bumped, but you know life happens! And you are doing an amazing job I think!
This weekend I am gonna have such a busy schedule, with lunches and parents and all kinds of actions in between…
I want to stay on top of my challenge, but I am pretty sure I’m gonna have to set my alarm at 5 a.m. both days just to get some work done… I’m still not sure if it’s worth losing my streak over, cause it’s really boosting to log in to those happy numbers, knowing I’m staying aced now that I’m out of a job
Keep going at it!If you really like the streak, you can also keep it going by using the Mobile app. If you’re away from the PC, you can use the practice packs on a mobile phone to practice and your streak will continue to count.Yeah I think that happened with me too recently. I no longer care. lolthat gonna be bad i dont really care about the streak but i try somtimes
then i found out this



 toastedpitabread:

It’s ok!! The challenge is more symbolic than anything. The fact that your following through is the real reward.

I see your point, I find that the codecademygo app gives an easy solution to this though. You can just spend 5 minutes reviewing something you have learned before and your streak will be kept. This has served me super well on the days where life got in the way of more substantial study. It also means I reviewed stuff more often than I would have just out of my own desire, which feels to me like a great outcome of something like a streaktracker.
Anyways, happy coding!"

will codecademy increase courses in future? I would suggest to make an course with Spring Boot for backend development. I found one course which fits to my goal but it is another technology stack (Node.js, Express.js and JavaScript). I also did programm an Rest API before with express.js and node.js but I want to continue coding in Java. I think Spring Boot is really useful for any Java developer and would be happy if codecademy would make an course about it.
It could also be interesting for many developer outside because most books I read about Spring and Spring Boot are not easy to understand. There are courses for at least 2000€ and it is too expensive for example students.

I have implemented regular Yoga, Language learning, Coding, Exercise, and other more general life habits very easily since I began using a habit tracker.
Personally I use Habitica (App and in browser) which is a gamified version of habit tracking that gives you xp for doing tasks that levels an RPG style character with a chosen class. I think many who are involved in coding would like this platform especially for a challenge like this.
My goal is to accrue an absurd daily record and, more deeply, to be ready for a career as soon as humanly possible.Thanks for sharing this.

19,Full Stack Engineer: Project at the wrong place,Bug Reporting,2,38,"I have been learning from the Full Stack Engineer Career Path for a while now and I’m currently on the Web Development Fundamentals Section.
I came across this project Build Your Own Cheatsheet. I guess this is wrongly placed.
To complete this project we need to have knowledge of HTML tables and I think it’s not been covered so far in this path. So there is practically no meaning of adding this project here.
I suggest to either remove this from the path or shift it to some other place where HTML tables have been covered.
Thank You.I expected at least a reply from the codecademy support staff that they have taken this into consideration but seems like since two days everybody is kinda busy with typescript.I think they took it into consideration already with the description of task #1 in the project.  It lists the prerequisites for the project and provides links to the courses. If someone isn’t comfortable, they can jump into those resources.

Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have completed the Codecademy Introduction to HTML course through the HTML tables lesson, and lessons in Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules.


I can’t recall if tables are specifically covered later in the Full-Stack Engineer career path, but I feel they do encourage the learner to be resourceful and to take advantage of documentation, which is very important in real-world scenarios."
20,Thoughts on De-bugging,Tips and Resources,11,96,"Hello all!
Fellow coding newbie here sharing some thoughts on debugging. I’d love to hear some of your thoughts on debugging, do you have any ideas, or tips you’d like to share?

De-bugging
Change your mindset
As a beginner to coding languages, you will come across errors and bugs in your code. Bugs and errors do not mean failure, nor do they imply you are bad at coding. It is another challenge to overcome, or opportunity to learn! Debugging is a key skill you will need to develop early. As with any skill, it will improve the more you practice. You should learn to enjoy the process, because the truth is, you will be spending a lot of time doing it.
We can spend hours in a state of frustration trying to get our code to work as we planned. Once our code works, we cheer, we share with our peers, job well done! Then, we are on to the next problem, implementation, or iteration, along with new bugs and errors. Fixing bugs and errors, you learn new things or remind yourself of something you have forgotten.
Types of errors
Before you think about techniques to deal with errors and bugs, you need to be aware of the mistakes you will make.
Syntax errors occur when you make a spelling or grammatical mistake in your code. Your program may crash or not run at all. By misspelling, and missing punctuation you will encounter Syntax errors. Modern code editors will highlight incorrect syntax in your code. This will help you with most common mistakes.
Runtime errors or 'bugs' do not appear until you attempt to run your program. Also called exceptions, the computer does not know how to handle the task defined in your code. An example of a runtime error would be attempting to divide a number by 0. Passing a 'falsy' value to some functions and methods can also result in runtime errors.
Semantic errors can be difficult to find. Your program will appear to run successfully. But the output returned is not what you were expecting. You have provided instructions that the computer understands. These instructions were not the instructions you intended to write. As the programmer, you will need to figure out what the program is doing.
Avoid de-bugging
With proper preparation and by taking things slow, you can avoid a lot of debugging.
First, it is important that you understand what you are trying to achieve. Imagine working toward a goal but you cannot recognise when you have succeeded, how do you know when to stop? You will not need a deep understanding of the entire problem. But you should have a good idea what the output should be, given a particular input. You can then adjust (debug) your program to achieve the correct solution.

Example
Write a program that demonstrates Pythagoras Theorem. This program should take two inputs from the user, a & b. These values represent the length of the sides of a right-angle triangle. It will the return to the user the length of the hypotenuse.

Receive input values from the user
Store these values
Square each value (multiply by self)
Add values together
Return square root of sum


Do not get carried away writing line after line of code. Lengthy functions containing calls to functions using various methods are difficult to debug. Start small, this way when your code does go wrong, you know where to begin looking. The last iteration of your code executed as intended, you have added two lines, now the program fails to run. Where did the error come from? Running your code or displaying your web page provides immediate feedback. Achieving small victories helps to keep you motivated. The feeling of defeat and failure is one of the biggest hinderances to your development.
I have written the below code in python3.4, it attempts to solve the problem explained above. The code covers steps 1 – 3 and gives an example of a typical error message. To complete the solution, you will need to import math on line 1. This will give you access to extra mathematical functions. Once the solution is complete think about what else you can add to this program. How could you add logic to allow the user to find length a given b and c?

1     side_a = input(“Side 1 length?”)
2     side_b = input(“Side 2 length?”) 
3 
4     print(side_a) 
5     print(side_b)  
6 

This iteration of the code covers steps 1 and 2 identified above.

Receive input values from the user
Store these values


1     side_a = input(“Side 1 length?”) 
2     side_b = input(“Side 2 length?”) 
3 
4     print(side_a * side_a) 
5     print(side_b * side_b) 
6 

This iteration of the code attempts to multiply each value by itself, then print the result to the user as a test. But, once the user inputs their values, the code returns a runtime error.

Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File ""C:\Users\user\Programming\ex_py_theorem.py"", line 4, in
    print(side_a * side_a) 
TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'

Fortunately the error message returned contains enough information to rectify the fault.

1     side_a = int(input(“Side 1 length?”)
2     side_b = int(input(“Side 2 length?”)
3  
4     a_squ = side_a * side_a 
5     b_squ = side_b * side_b 
6 
7     print(a_squ) 
8     print(b_squ) 
9

This resolves the error and allows the code to run. The values received from inputs are string values. We need them to be integer values for mathematical operations. The values are then stored into new variables for clarity and then printed as a test.
With a simple program working, you can begin making improvements . Again, make small adjustments and additions to your code. These changes will help you to move closer to your goal. Each step of the way you should test your changes and inspect the output. Repeating this process helps you to understand the solution to the problem on a deeper level. You will have a better understanding of the structure and flow of your program.
Why I like debugging
I have noticed the more debugging I do, I become better at writing code. It helps me to learn what works and what does not, and highlights areas for more study. The computer is never wrong. I cannot argue with a computer, I must be humble and acknowledge my code is incorrect. It is like playing a video game. I learn how to fail and then how to overcome. Each exercise in debugging scales in difficulty with my ability. The better I get the more challenging the bugs and errors become. I am a detective . Debugging allows me to use a different set of skills and allows me to embrace my inner Sherlock. Observation, deduction, and logical reasoning are all skills that develop with practice.
Tools and Aids
VSCode
This code editor is my favourite so far; it has a huge number of features built in to help you write working programs. Linters, and text highlighting to point out mistakes before you even test. Git revision management tools are very useful with larger projects. There are a lot of great code editors out there, find your favourites and learn to use it well. You may find yourself preferring different editors for different tasks.
DevTools
When working on any web development project, you will want to see the changes you are making. Testing the page and inspecting elements as you build helps you to remain in control. DevTools allows you to change CSS values so that you can see the effects before making changes to your code. DevTools also features a console for testing out JavaScript.
Console logs and print statements
Adding print statements allows you to check that your program is working as you intended. You can print values to the console and check they are as expected. You can also use a function to find the type of a variable, useful for dealing with type errors. You can remove these statements once you have proven the program.
Commenting out code
Commenting out the code in the error message can help you to locate the error. Comment tags tell the computer to ignore lines of code. Once you have an idea where the error lies, you can start investigating. Look at syntax, spelling, and what your program is doing as opposed to what you intend it to do.
Work backward from the error message
The error indicates where the program has stopped. The error will relate to either the line identified, or it will have come before. It is important you understand the flow of your program and follow the function calls. Sometimes an error message will identify an error in one file, but the mistake is in another linked file.
Style Guides
Clean code keeps your code tidy and readable, for yourself and others. The easier your code is to read the easier it is to spot errors and mistakes. Make use of white space and line breaks. Keeping your code tidy will help when you start refactoring to make your code more concise.
Documentation
Programming documentation should become your go to reference whilst writing and debugging. Within documentation you can look up various objects, their methods, and parameters. Not only will this help you fix mistakes but learn things you did not know were possible. Documentation contains syntax rules and code examples, the pages can be daunting. With practice finding the information you need becomes easier.

I hope this post helps fellow beginners with their coding journey. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on debugging. Stay motivated, don't quit, you got this!When I have to do debugging I typically filter out all the different paragraphs of code, then I individually run them each, and see hat one doesn’t work.  I then do the same thing again with that code until I find the one that doesn’t work, then I try to find a way to fix that.print() statements are my friends. Prove a line of code at a time. That’s been my way from the start. Mind, I’m still messing with a line of code at a time, and not much else. Perpetual beginner, I guess.Terminal and console interactive debugging. I’ll even use it to test small chunks of code before putting it into a larger body of a program.
Also good awareness of edge cases and meaningful naming of things both save a lot of pain down the line.


 toastedpitabread:

good awareness of edge cases and meaningful naming of things


… which again comes down to proving one line at a time. It’s the only way we can narrow down to the edge cases. Well, maybe not one line, but one simple function. Breaking that function is our goal. Until it can no longer be broken we don’t give up. That can boil down to a single line of code…Glad to see you’ve got a positive outlook on debugging!
It is too easy to see it as a nuisance rather than as a critical (and sometimes even fun or interesting) part of the learning process.I am familiar with the concept of isolating parts of the code and running them. How do you do this? Would this involve commenting out code or simulating it elsewhere? I normally run the whole thing, regularly.Commenting is one way to isolate, but it can get messy. In a sandbox create the snippet you wish to prove and put it through the paces. When satisfied, insert the module into your working project.Thanks for the speedy response !
I’ll look into it, I think this will help me a lot.
I’m currently working with JavaScript things are getting complicate !repl.it is free and provides a sandbox for a wide variety of languages. Sign up and start playing. Be sure to give your projects a name so you can find them later. REPL.IT will give it a random meaningless name, otherwise.Look up unit testing and unit testing frameworks for whatever language you are using."

We’re super stoked to release this feature because it will allow you to set a weekly goal and reward your streak on a weekly rather than a daily basis.
The goal of this feature is to help you build more sustainable learning habits since we found that daily commitment was difficult to sustain in the long term.
You can find this feature on your homepage banner as shown below:

Regards,
Richie   How do I turn this off? and all other the other congratulation notifications?Hey @cerberus0013, currently you can’t turn off the weekly targets feature.
However, I will look into the congratulations notifications for you as there might be an issue there.
Thanks for your feedback Awesome, thank you.
Because the issue I’m having is that the congratulation notifications won’t go away.
If there are multiple notifications its the last one that stays, if it’s just one then thats the one that stays.
Then the notification just continually pops in and out when I go to the next instruction, come back to the page, and then just at random times, ect. And I’m not able to press the X to delete it or anythingHey @cerberus0013,
Looks like we’ve address the issue! You should be all set now "
25,What was your win this week?,Random,16,187,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not! 

Did you learn something new?
Did you start a new project with skills that you learned online?
Did you help someone else out?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! Code-related: I finished the Python Classes module and medical ins. project on the DS path. I also made some basic data vizzes with covid19 data from the covid tracking project.
Non-coding: I finished crocheting a small blanket that is ultimately for my cat and am almost finished with a small “lapghan” for myself. Yay! Oh, and I also made a hat for myself. Super simple pattern too!  Code-related: I had to present one of my Data Science projects to some people at my mom’s convention. It was soo stressful but it went well!
Non-code related: My parents got me a laptop! Now I don’t have to struggle with my laggy Dell computer when I’m coding. I lost my NJHS election btw, but at least I learned a lot in the process!Code related: I reached the 30% checkpoint on the full-stack path.
Non-code related: This week I started day to day planning to be more effective.Coding related: I am almost there with the PostgreSQL Skill Path, and I saw there were new things in the Analyze Data with SQL Path (which I had completed some time ago), so I’m gonna start working on that too.
More exciting than that, I was trying to write a hard SQL query (well it was for me lol), and after 1 hour, I DID IT! 
I learned about the LAG() and DATEDIFF() functions while I was at it, I enjoyed it a lot :3
Non-coding related: A bunch of art stuff nobody wants to hear about lol. But this was mainly a “codey” week (pretty sure that word doesn’t exist but anyway).Code-related: I finally finished a lesson on Python that I was struggling on. 
Non-code related: I have made way more progress on a 2000 piece puzzle I have been working on.Code related: finished a module on introductory javascript and i´m keeping my goal of doing 1% of my full stack engineering program daily!
Non-code related: finally figured what exactly i want out of programming and how to get there.Code-related I enrolled in a training for Backend Developer, part of which is helping me find a job in the field. This, on top of all the things I can learn here, has brightened my prospects for the future.
As for non-code: I finally found an organic way to bring a couple of characters together in a story I’m writing, and it’s really enjoyable to write their interactions.Code: I completed a part of a project that was assigned to me as part of university project. I also completed the FlattenArrayN challenge hosted at codecademy and made progress in the full stack path.
Non-Code: I hosted my second weekly focus session this week. It was fun and we had more participants. I have a weekly study/coding time of more than 40 hours and I’m super proud of it.Nope, you’re wrong. Everyone wants to always hear about art stuff happening!
Congrats on your progress by the way I’m sure your cat will love your blanket, but will prefer your hat to sleep in Aw thank you so much for the encouragement 
Then I shall share my art win of last week:
I learned not to be afraid to draw the things that I truly want to draw. Maybe they’ll turn out bad, maybe people won’t like them, but I draw for myself. If I like and enjoy my art, that’s all that matters A friend of mine is an artist too (mainly watercolor and ink). She was a professional for a while, but it fell through because people won’t pay much for art even in the best of times, and times aren’t very good at the moment. Eventually she was forced to re-educate herself to get a job in a different field.
During the last year(s) of trying to keep afloat she started painting and drawing more and more what she thought people wanted from her rather than her own ideas. She lost all enjoyment she got from it. It used to be her way of expressing herself, and it wasn’t that anymore.
The other day I was at her place and she told me exactly the same as you said! She enjoyed doing her thing again, because now she was doing it for herself, and with ideas that she wanted to work with. And she showed me some things she’d been working on, some really good pieces (to my totally not professional opinion anyway  )
Well, sorry for rant, but the moral of the story: you learned a very important lesson. Hang on to it!My win for the week were as follows:

Code-related: I started the Full Stack Developer Path this week and find this all very interesting and motivating
Non-Code-related: really looking forward to start running again, maybe I can do another marathon next year

One thing that I really enjoyed was getting both of Jon Duckett’s books (JavaScript & JQuery / HTML & CSS) and must say, I am amazed by how beautiful and well written they are…

27,From absolutely non-technical occupation to pro web- and mobile developer in 1.5 years,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",22,2.4k,"Hi there!
I’d love to share my story for the others not to lose their faith in themselves.
About 1.5 years ago I was sitting in my room tired after the day of work i did not enjoy that much. I have a friend who is a developer and I really enjoyed having conversations with him. I myself wasn’t any sort of success in maths or other technical sciences in school and my occupation was an English-Russian translator. Coming back to that day, I asked myself what if there is a chance for a person like me in a software development world? What if I can work with interesting tasks along with nice guys like my friend? Can I even try?
I am from Russia and I didn’t like the opportunities I had in my small town to learn the needed skills. Then I found this very place online - codecademy. I liked the interface from the very start - clean, simple, beautiful. Then I tried learning HTML. I wasn’t that easy for me, but to say the truth it was exactly what I needed: not too easy and not too hard for a person to study it after a full working day. I tried to study at least 4 days in a week and I did more if I could. I finished HTML course in about a 1.5 or 2 months.
Studying HTML/CSS formed a good positive attitude - my success and a big aim of having a meaningful interesting job and a wealthy life didn’t let me go. Then things went a bit hard when I came to advanced CSS and JavaScript lessons.
I forgot to say that very quickly I decided that I need a Pro program to have an access to tests and projects. Maybe some people are able to remember things and build systems of knowledge in their head without practicing on projects and revisiting passed lessons in tests, but I’m definitely not one of them.
During JS course I faced some problems I couldn’t solve for several days and it frustrated me. Again, I had this forum to ask, I had CodeCademy advisors and StackOverflow but I didn’t want to go for their help right away as soon as I met some challenging task. At that time I had many doubts that I fit for this. But a big aim in my head and responsibility I feel for my wife, future kids and my parents gave me strength to go on in times of doubt. Don’t get me wrong - development consists of challenging tasks and this is exactly why you have a sense of meaning and deep satisfaction when you solve them. This is totally worth it. You’ll have enough positive feelings, believe me!
Over time I finished JS course and had a look at a chart of JS technologies by their popularity in professional environment, a number of job positions, and salary. I decided to pick React.js, maybe not for the right reasons but still this was a good decision. Later on I realized that you can do Android and iOS apps with it too. It was easier as it is based on JS, but it took a while to sink into my way of thinking of front-end development.
As I finished all the necessary courses I decided that I need to build a portfolio so I made myself a website and I also made one for a local restaurant I liked to visit. I made it for free to get a chance to get an experience and to make something useful that I’ll personally like.
After that I started to study Redux since it was required for the most React positions. At the same time I decided to put my resume and portfolio online, I mentioned that I can move to another city - and it changed very much for me since in my place there were very few positions for junior React developers. My advice - pay attention to its structure. It should be clear and straight to the point, but it should show you as a professional who can do the task (and it must be true).
I wanted to train to go through an interview. I tried to prepare myself that most employers will say no, because I was not that experienced, but it still was hard for me to hear their negative decisions. At the other hand It allowed me to see my weak points and rapidly heal the weak spots.
I must say that if you’re a junior you generally have a better chance in a larger company with a big number of developers since for them it doesn’t take that much to find you a mentor among a crowd of developers and allow him to spend his potential on you. Small startups have fewer mature developers and if they are hiring - they need seniors since they don’t have as much money and time to invest in juniors, they need to get the job done at an optimized cost.
Make sure to learn from negative interviews to make them positive for you personally. Your only goal here is to see your weak points, to fix them and to make it better next time. If you learn - inevitably in several iterations you’ll be successful. Feeling down is normal but don’t forget your big goal and go on. Your patience and wisdom will pay off over time.
After a couple of months of having interviews two companies became interested in me - one worked in education, the other was one of the biggest banks in the country and after interviews with them I had offers from both of them.
I made my decision and moved to Moscow - a way better place comparing to the place I lived before, and now I am a React developer in one of the largest banks. It all is thanks to the skills I developed when studying here and the ones I’ve got from failed interviews I had for two months.
My lesson - Be happy when everything goes right, and keep doing what you need to do at difficult times. The ones who didn’t overcome these difficulties gave opportunity for me to take their place. Be one of those who go on when they feel stressed. But again - most of the time everything is fine and you feel satisfaction and positive emotions. Don’t blame yourself for failures - be thankful for them if they are not fatal and learn from them.
Be sure to have a worthy goal to help you go your way.
Ask me any questions - I’d love to answer if I can!
Cheers and stay strong!


 opensky1988:

Don’t blame yourself for failures - be thankful for them if they are not fatal and learn from them.


To be a little softer, and not call them failures, my choice phrase is,

Revel in mistakes, and learn what we can from them.

Same message, though. You haven’t sold yourself short. Good job!I have a lot to learn in English. Thank you for the advice! It sounds way more friendly when you put it this way.opensky1988,
Thank you very much for sharing your experience. I am just now beginning this journey in earnest and hope that I too will be able to move from where I am now into a place where I would much rather be. Kudos to you!Great job! I like to hear these kinds of stories. This gives me confidence that anyone can become a developer if they put in the sweat and determination to become whatever they wish. I wish you well on your future endeavors!Geez, it’s hard being a talentless hack. I’ve been learning Web Dev for more than 5 years and I got nowhere close to an interview or freelancing gig. Congrats to you though.Thank you! Be strong and patient and move to your goal despite all the obstacles and life will give you what you need. Thank you!
I think so too. Anyone can do anything. Skill requires everyday practice to become and stay stable and reliable. If we stop walking or talking - we lose even these basic skills, so we need to practice everyday. It feels very uncomfortable and slow in the beginning, but over time it becomes natural and you become so-called pro.  Talent is overrated.Thanks. It’s not only about time range but about intensity too. I had been studying for several hours almost everyday. And I really wanted to get into a professional environment. If you’ll prepare yourself, make many tries, and learn from mistakes you’ll get your chance, I’m sure!Thank you for the story. I’m considering a similar change myself. Transitioning from construction to programming. I’m glad to learn that there people that have taken up a similar journey. Glad to know it is possible.
Will make myself ready for the challenges.This is so possible, it’s hard to imagine. If you’re willing to pay the price - time and effort - you’ll succeed. And I wish you that!Hey! Great story thanks for sharing! Its very inspiring to hear others are in similar situations. I mysef am 33 and just sadly closed my restaurant as the bills need to get paid. I enjoy coding on my own time and thought it would be a great transition for myself.
My question to anyone who reads this is what are their thoughts on someone who is Bilingual? I understand the code itself doesn’t change language but I thought could this be of an advantage to me when looking for employment next year?  I am both French and English and could use either as a Primary language so I thought maybe someone else has had an experience in where companies would look at that as an asset?
Thank you again and thanks for sharing!Keep learning and practicing and you’ll do it.
I personally don’t see bilingualism as any sort of advantage in the industry.Is it a must to upgrade to pro user? or i can actually learn without upgrading?Well, you can, but it didn’t work as much for me. Tests and projects made me remember the information and embed it into a knowledge structure in my head.
But technically, if this is not your first language you can learn without Pro membership.ok thank you very much!thanks for the great story. it motivates me to know others went through this. am not alone, they made it so i can too.You definitely can, Dennis! Keep it up!Hi and thank you for the story — it is really motivating! I am from Russia too though now live in Czech Republic. As I worked in advertising and journalism while living in Russia, I have serious problems with getting a job here due to the language barrier. This is quite frustrating. However, I decided to try myself in web-development.
You wrote that you began building your portfolio after finishing all the courses. I started the Codeacademy web-development path only a week ago, so this question may seem stupid or strange, but is there an opportunity to make some works (maybe little and simple) for the portfolio while you are studying? In order to have at least something after finishing the courses to start looking for the Junior positions as soon as possible?Hello there!
To your question - yes, totally! As soon as you feel you have enough competence to make a viable project - you can do it! And it will be great for you because people want to see what you can do: your choosing style, architecture, tools choise, etc. And the project they can touch and see is the best help for you here.
Also when implementing your own ideas you meet situations with typical problems and you learn the typical ways to solve them. So the are many benefits from that. You can build your own simple project or participate in open source project. In the very beginning don’t look for the money. Look for relevant experience."

Feel free to share how you might overcome these situations.At times I have had issues understanding . But, when I get stuck or don’t comprehend what I’m reading I just Google it and refer to the official documentation or other resources that describe concepts & terminology differently. Then I get it. imperative, abstract, functional, expressive, &c.

33,"A Day in the Life: Sylvana Santos, Codecademy Software Engineer","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,540,"This month, we’re featuring Sylvana Santos who works on Codecademy’s software engineering team. Fascinated with the intersection of education and technology, Sylvana is in her dream job at Codecademy. Outside of Codecademy, Sylvana enjoys taking her bunny for a walk, watching and playing soccer, cooking herself a nice meal, or practicing yoga!
Meet Sylvana! 
Tell us a little about yourself.
Hi there! My name is Sylvana, and I’m a software engineer at Codecademy. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, but now I live in Brooklyn with my bunny, Pepper. I love watching and playing soccer. I can’t wait until I can play with Codecademy’s team! Other than that, I enjoy cooking (but more so eating), thrifting, and watching tiny house videos.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
Codecademy was a dream company for me. During college, I became fascinated with the intersection of education and technology. I was inspired by the many ways that people were using tech to address gaps in our education system. I wanted to be a part of that revolution, so when I learned about Codecademy and its mission, I was thrilled! After I graduated from Fullstack Academy, I applied for the Codecademy apprenticeship, and more recently, I made the transition to full time. I feel so blessed to be working here, and I can say that it has lived up to all my expectations.
Did you always want to be a software engineer?
No. It took a while for me to figure out what I wanted to do. In college, I studied electrical engineering, but I wasn’t a huge fan. So I would spend my summers exploring adjacent fields. In my last summer, I worked with a professor to create an Android application to help students learn circuit basics. That was my first time coding, and I fell in love. From that point forward, I started teaching myself to code and that’s also when I heard about Codecademy. After graduation, I worked as a teacher and continued to learn programming on the side. Eventually, I decided to join a coding bootcamp and the rest fell into place.
What are the best aspects about working as a software engineer?
Getting to work with other talented engineers. I get to see how different people think about the same problem and how they form solutions. I’m also constantly being challenged and learning along the way. Not a day goes by where I don’t learn a new trick, deal with a new framework, or tackle a weird bug.
What are the worst aspects about working as a software engineer?
The flip side to my last response is that working on software is very humbling. There’s always more to learn. Another framework. Another language. Another library. Sometimes this makes you feel like others are miles ahead of you or that you will never have it all together. But this is what I’ve learned: no one has it all together. We all know bits and bobs. Relish in your own growth.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
The Stormbreaker computer from the Alex Rider series (minus the smallpox virus, obviously). This computer was capable of immersing students into different environments. They could pet dinosaurs, float in outer space. As a kid, this sounded amazing. It still does. Google Expeditions 10 is a great start, but it’s not the fully immersive experience promised by Stormbreaker.
Do you have any advice for the learners?
Don’t be afraid to ask questions and boldly proclaim the wrong answer. In college, I felt silly admitting that I was confused. So I just stayed confused. When I started my coding bootcamp, I was adamant about not making the same mistake. I started asking for clarity, reaching out to people for help, and participating in discussions (even when I didn’t feel confident). It made such a huge difference in the quality of my learning!
Also, I have found that teaching others really helps solidify concepts. If you can find ways to teach the concepts you are learning, definitely take advantage of that opportunity. Sometimes, I just ask people if I can walk them through my understanding of a topic and even just that helps a lot.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Building mobile applications with Flutter. It’s a framework, created by Google, that allows you to build applications for both Android and iOS. I worked with Flutter on a couple of side projects, and I found it to be well-documented and fun. Cross platform applications are very popular right now, so it would be great if we could introduce our users to this concept. If you are interested, I recommend going through one of the codelabs 10.
What does a typical day look like for you?
I like to wake up early, grab a glass of water, put on some music, and get straight to work. After a couple hours of focused time, I do a quick workout and make myself a smoothie. By then, our team will have daily standup, where we go around and update each other on our progress. After this, I spend about an hour reviewing PRs. The rest of my day is spent in team meetings, pair programming sessions, or solo coding time.
Fun fact   I started working at Codecademy when everything went remote, so I have not actually met most of my coworkers. Kinda strange. One thing that I have found helpful in integrating into the company is setting up chats with random people. We have a slackbot that automatically does this for you, but I also just like randomly inviting people to virtual lunches. Also! By the late afternoon, I normally can’t focus and my back reminds me that I am slowly aging, so I like to take a longer break and do some yoga before returning to my work. At the end of the day, I like to take my bunny for a walk, make myself a nice meal, and then just sink into my bed to watch an episode of Monk.

Hello @net9445459578, welcome to the forums! If you can, take a path like frontend or full-stack (however they need PRO), as they involve many small projects within them. The best way to convince customers (apart from major certifications) is to have a good portfolio  of projects you hav e completed to show them what you can do. To build websites you will need HTML and CSS (so if you don’t want to pay for PRO, you could take these courses. If you want to add some interactivity to your website (still on the frontend), you should learn JavaScript.Thank you very much, I’ll look into those.Yeah, pro would be a good idea, and good luck, I hope you do good!

35,Question about the forums,Community,2,44,"Hello World!
I’ve been using codecademy for about 3ish weeks now. I just finished my js part II code challenges to intermediate javascript. They were something else.
That’s the reason  for my post. As most of us, we’re out here doing this on our own. There were sometimes that I was stuck for so long and didn’t want to hit view solution to make sure that i’m figure it out to ensure that I’m soaking in the material. However, there have been times that when I finally figure it out. I dont have a solid grasp on why it worked and would help if i had people to talk through it.
Thank god so far this hasn’t happened too often. However i’m getting to a point now that it’s getting more challenging and I dont really have anybody to ask for help as i don’t know anybody else that codes. I’ve never been on any forums before and I realize if I search I can always find the same problem i’m working on and then the answer. I dont really want to see the answer and would rather post to talk to someone that can guide me through the answer to learn the concept.
I’m not going to get shunned for reposting the same ? that someone else posted on a different thread am i !? I’d just like to talk some of these things through with somebody.
Thanks and sorry for the long post!!

Hi there.
I can say with a good degree of certainty that if you were to post a question about any of the lessons or exercises from the Codecademy material, you’ll probably get a response from one of our incredible group of Super Users who’ll talk you through the material without giving you a complete solution.
The Super Users (SU’s for short) are Codecademy users just like you, who also spend their time here on the forums helping people who are stuck and passing along what they’ve learned along the way. 
Alternatively, if you’d like a more immediate channel for conversation about whatever you’re stuck on, there’s an official community Discord channel where you can talk code with other learners:




Official Codecademy Discord Server Community


    The Codecademy Moderator Teams has created a Discord Server for you to connect with other Codecademy learners over real-time chat. 
You can use this space to communicate on group projects, find a code buddy, ask questions, and much more! 
Feel free to come chat with us if you need help or just want to talk to fellow developers like yourself. 
Join us in Discord via the link: https://discord.gg/nGqWeYN 
*Discord is a communication platform that offers over voice, video, and text.
  

Awesome thank you so much for the link to the discord! That’s going to help so much.
I appreciate you explaining the SUs and I’ll make sure to leverage the forums and discord.

I am just wondering if there are any meetups in Australia, even virtual ones? I live in Brisbane Australia and want to meet some more programmers out there but unsure how to! I have been studying Java at uni, but on my break I want to start the front end web dev course on codecademy. Any advice or tips for meeting other programmers would be great
Cheers
JonoHello and welcome to the forums.
New Codecademy chapters are starting up all over! I realize that Melbourne isn’t nearby, but, there is a chapter there:

Happy coding!Hey Jono, I’m down in Melbourne and just starting out on the Full Stack path here on codecademy.
If you find any others, let me know!

37,Accountability Partner,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,6,76,"Hello,
This is just a suggestion but I’d very much appreciate it if you would pass it to somebody responsible for these decisions.
I came across this article: https://www.quietrev.com/forget-mentors-find-an-accountability-partner/ 3
I think that it can play a huge role in the learn-to-code process. It can be as simple as pairing up with somebody with similar goals.
What do you think? @lilybirdHave you checked the Discord channel or the FB group? You might find someone there or a group who is also looking for an accountability partner.@lisalisaj My bad, I should communicate it better. I’m not looking for an accountability partner.
This is more of a feature request because I know other online educational companies who have successfully implemented such tool with a high success rate + people love it and are having so much fun with it.
So I thought it’s a good idea if codecademy itself would encourage that and maybe implement it based on the feedback from users.Hey @adriansomor! I think an accountability buddy or study group is essential to learning something new and making great progress, so I really appreciate you calling attention to it. While we do not auto-pair learners with other learners, we do have something similar set in place: Codecademy Chapters. Back in September 2020, we launched Codecademy Chapters as a way for Codecademy learners to meet each other and study together. With Chapters, you can join one and attend a meetup to connect with others who are learning the same subject as you.
I used to host weekly group focus sessions and invite any learner who would like to attend. After learners joined a few sessions and got to know one another, a few of them decided to team up outside of the group session to work on the Data Scientist Path together!
@goku-kun @cvrloskenobi1 you guys met in my group focus sessions, and now you’re leading a Codecdaemy Chapter together! Can you say more about how you teamed up? And please add anything else that Adrian (and other learners) might find helpful when trying to find an accountability buddy.I think that working together is already encouraged (or, an overriding theme)----here, on Discord and on FB (I’m not on FB so I can’t say with 100% certainty) as well as in the CC chapters that Lil mentioned above. I think the onus more lies upon the individual to make it happen and reach out to other likeminded people. Chapters are a great starting point. Hey, @lilybird and @adriansomor. I met @cvrloskenobi1 through the focus sessions that Lil used to host, as she said above. And, during one of those sessions, Carlos mentioned that he was also working on the data scientist path, same as me. So, we got connected with the help of the codecademy discord server. And then, just talked it out. It’s always fun to learn with a peer. There are so many things that you can do as a learner if you have a buddy/buddies working on the same lessons as you. You can discuss, try to challenge each other based on the topic that you just learned and much more.
The best way to determine for yourself if you understood the topic as well as you think you did, is to try explaining the topic to others and you’ll find out exactly what you did and didn’t understand. I and, Carlos, have started working on the Data Scientist path and now, we even meet weekly using the focus sessions that we host. Apart from that, we have also shared our github account information with each other and created a data scientist repository where we make cheat sheets about the lessons, together, and also review it on our own time. So, that kinda adds as an extra layer of what we’re trying to do and gives more experience as to how one would collaborate with others in the real time.
I think sometimes you just have to take the plunge without thinking too much about it and then see for yourself if it worked out for you or not. If it did, improve upon it and if it didn’t, change the flow! Either way, you’re taking responsibility for yourself and that’s growth as far as I’m concerned.
I’ve also connected with @adriansomor through discord and we’ve talked about many things. Looking forward to working with you, @adriansomor. So cool, thanks for sharing @goku-kun!"
38,"I’m back, so what next?","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",2,44,"My boss just agreed to me doing another year on Codecademy Pro!
In my first year, alongside a full time job managing a website and doing comms, I completed exactly half the web development path (stopped somewhere in intermediate javascript) and then the php course. As a result, I’m able to make helpful little changes to the big complex website I manage (mostly css, so far) and try out my own little projects. Honestly, a few minutes of Codecademy every day has been the thing that’s got me through working from home. I’m really excited to be back after a few weeks without it!
Over the next year we’re looking at a developing a custom app for our charity. I don’t know yet whether I could develop the skills to do some or all of this myself, or whether that makes sense.
I know the courses and career paths shuffled a bit recently, but my web development course still seems to be there. I’m wondering whether to carry on with that, or whether I should look at something more focussed, if my goal is to get a sense of what designing a mobile app from scratch would look like. I’d love to hear suggestions if you have them!When building a mobile application, the first question should be: I am going to develop native applications or going for a hybrid solution?
if you are going native (java or kotlin for android, swift for ios), you get two code-bases/projects. Which is more work
if you decide to go hybrid (one code base), you need to decide what to use, there are several options. If you already know html, css and JS a good option would be react native. so then after Javascript, learn react, after react, learn react native.
php can also be useful to the API for your mobile application.
There are a lot of options and possibilities.Thank you @stetim94 that’s a helpful starting point."
39,Rust Programing,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,199,"Is there any chance we can get Rust in codeacademy?
The reason is that I am asked to learn it for a new job and it is getting very popular.Hi @olimpiu! Thanks for sharing this. I’ve sent your request to our Curriculum team to see there a chance of us creating this course sometime in the near future. Will circle back here once I get word from the team I would also be very interested in a Rust course. As it can be used both for system-level programming and in the browser to speed up client-side scripts. Rust can be compiled to WebAssembly, which works natively in the browser alongside JS. I think the most interesting and useful tutorial would be a simple React application with Rust compiled to WebAssembly, maybe even with different bundlers (WebPack, Parcel v1 and v2, Rollup)."

41,[Challenge] Reverse Words,Featured Challenges and Events,105,24.5k,"#Code Challenge: May 3, 2017
Every week, we feature the type of brain-teasing question that might be asked in a full-stack developer’s job interview, similar to the FizzBuzz Challenge often used at places like Facebook and Google.
For this week’s challenge, inspired by a question reported to have been asked in developer job interviews at Microsoft (and also inspired by Yoda in honor of Star Wars Day!):

Write a function that will take a given string 171 and reverse the order of the words. “Hello world” becomes “world Hello” and “May the Fourth be with you” becomes “you with be Fourth the May”

 28
You may assume that the string is a sentence that contains only letters and spaces, with all words separated by one space.
If you find this challenge easy, that’s actually not unusual in interview situations, but interviewers often ask you to not only thoroughly explain your process but to up your game in an extension to the initial challenge, so you should definitely try for extra credit (see below)!
####Scroll down and reply to this thread with your code to participate!  Don’t just submit your code, remember to explain your solution, too!  If you want your entry to be considered under our “best code” assessment, you must link to your code running on repl.it 253 to make assessing your entry easier (see below).

##Extra Credit
###Intermediate difficulty

The string in question now has punctuation, for example “Hello world!” and “With you, be May the Fourth”  Write a function to reverse the order of words, but keep the punctuation in place.  For example, turn ""Hello world!"" into “world Hello!” and “With you, be May the Fourth.” to “Fourth the, May be you With.”

In the case of multiple consecutive punctuation marks or multiple consecutive whitespace characters, deal with them as you see fit.
This week, our easy level challenge is a little easier than normal, so only submissions at intermediate level and above will be eligible to “win” this challenge.
###Hard Difficulty
If you’d like to go even further:

Can you solve the initial challenge (without punctuation) in-place 134 without using additional data structures 93, and with the time complexity 78 being O(n)?  Can you do the same for the intermediate level challenge (including punctuation)?

Learn more about Big O notation and time complexity here 111 and here 55.  There’s also an old (and thus unsupported) Codecademy course on Big O 83, if you prefer.

#The Winners
See the full list and feedback here.

##How to participate


Use any language taught on Codecademy (Python 46, Java 47, Ruby 18, JavaScript 71, PHP 19, etc.)


Submissions in C++, C, or other languages not taught on Codecademy are welcomed, but these may not be eligible to “win” as a featured submission (see below)


Please include a link to your code running on repl.it 253, or as a backup CodePen 21, JSFiddle 23, or CodeBits 35 so that our team (and your fellow students) can assess your submission easier and faster - if we have dozens of submissions, we will not have time to assess entries that do not have links in this manner.


If you want to post your code directly, please make sure that it is correctly formatted 33!


The best submission or submissions will be featured here on the forums and via various social media channels (like our Twitter 14)


Solutions submitted before 6:00pm in New York City on the Friday immediately following the code challenge are eligible for consideration as a featured “best entry.”


Some of the criteria we use to judge a “best submission” are the simplicity, elegance, creativity, and efficiency of your submission.  Languages like Python will often have an advantage over languages like JavaScript, so we’ll take that into account when judging a winner - the “best” entry or entries may not all be the fastest or most efficient.


To be considered as a “best submission,” you must explain your thought processes in making your answer: how and why you designed your function the way you did.  This way, we’ll be more sure that you came up with your own solution, but crucially this is part of the reason why this type of question is asked in job interviews.


####Happy coding!

The fine print:

Remember, the point of code challenges like these is to test and stretch yourself with an unusual problem, so don’t be dissuaded if you find it difficult or don’t know where to start!  Start with Googling, but see if you can find out how to think about the problem and what tools you need to solve it, but don’t just go looking for the solution itself.  This way, it’ll be a better learning exercise for you - developers can’t always find and copy “the right answer” online, which is why questions like these are used in developer job interviews!  Interviewers want to be able to see how you think through problems and not just whether or not you can solve them.
If you are interested in “winning” the code challenge, please don’t use any unusual repos or anything that will make it difficult for us or your fellow users to assess your answer quickly.
Do you have a code challenge to share with other users?  Issue it!  Make a new topic with [Challenge] in the title to open a challenge, maybe we’ll even feature it in our next newsletter!

Yaay I get to be first!

function reverseString(string) {
  var words = string.split(' ').reverse().join(' ');
  
  document.body.innerHTML += words;
}

reverseString('May the Fourth be with you');

I have turned the string into an array, reversed it, then joined it back togetherdef str_reverse(text):
    ''' function to reverse the words in a string '''

    # split text on spaces and store in a list
    lst = text.split(sep=' ')

    # step through the list in reverse order
    rev = lst[::-1]

    # join reversed list with a space between words to produce final string
    return ' '.join(rev)


print(str_reverse('Hello world'))

def reverseString(string)
words = string.split("" “).reverse.join(” "")
end
https://repl.it/HeEu/0 17Rather than loop through the string and add a space, you should just be able to perform a .join(’ '); on your array with the separator defined as a space to convert the array back to a string with each element of that array separated by the space.https://repl.it/embed/HeFX/12.js 19let string = ""May the Fourth be with you"";
let stringAsArray = string.split(' ').reverse();
let newString = stringAsArray.join(' ');
document.body.textContent = newString;
Here’s my try with JavaScript.
I used the string split method to transform the string into an array of elements, by inserting a “,” wherever a space appeared, then I used a simple for loop to counter backwards and write the words from the last itens to the first in the document, there was a bug with the length of the array, I just subtract one from the array.length to fix it.
See the Pen YVxWWJ 35 by Francisco Santos (@FrankZang) on CodePen 3.My first time commenting a solution. Beginner style
Private Function ReverseString(ByVal targetString As String) As String
        Dim textArray As String() = Split(targetString, "" "")
        Dim reverseText As String = """"

        For i As Integer = (textArray.Length - 1) To 0 Step -1
            reverseText += (textArray(i) + "" "")
        Next

        Return reverseText
    End Function
Beginner:
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use 5.18.0;
say join("" "", reverse(split(/ /, ""Codeacademy is really cool"")));

Intermediate/Hard:
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use 5.018;

my @tokens = split /\b/, ""With you, be May the Fourth."";

my ($left, $right) = (0, $#tokens);

while ($left < $right) {
    ++$left  while ($left < $right && $tokens[$left]  =~ /\W/);
    --$right while ($left < $right && $tokens[$right] =~ /\W/);
    @tokens[$left, $right] = @tokens[$right, $left];
    ++$left;
    --$right;
}

say @tokens;


First I split the string on “word boundaries” (/\b/), which splits the example string like this:
 0  'With'
 1  ' '
 2  'you'
 3  ', '
 4  'be'
 5  ' '
 6  'May'
 7  ' '
 8  'the'
 9  ' '
10  'Fourth'
11  '.'

Then I initialize two index variables ($left and $right) pointing to the first and last token respectivelly.
Then I move the left index to the right and the right index to the left until both point to words, making sure they don’t pass over each other. In this situation I swap the words and try to move the indexes again to find the next pair of words.
When the index pass each other I print the @tokens array, which had its words swapped as required.function reverseThis(sentence) {
   var result = sentence.split("" "").reverse().join("" "");
   return result;
}

https://repl.it/HeJM/0 14oh yeah, thanks. Updated.
Might try and get it working with punctuation too.// Easy
function reverseString(s) {
	return s.split("" "").reverse().join("" "");
}

console.assert(reverseString('Hi there mate') === 'mate there Hi', 'Sentences do not match');

// Intermediate 
function reverseStringV2(s) {
  const punctuationInString = s.split("" "").map((word) => word.replace(/[^.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=\-_`~()]/g, """"));
	return s.split("" "").map((word) => word.replace(/[.,\/#!$%\^&\*;:{}=\-_`~()]/g, """")).reverse().map((word, index) => word.concat(punctuationInString [index])).join("" "");
}

console.assert(reverseStringV2('With you, be May the Fourth.') === 'Fourth the, May be you With.', 'Sentences do not match');

For easy I split the string in to an array, reverse it and join it back up again where each word is joined with a space.
For intermediate I create a new array of just the punctuation in the given string by negating a regex to rip out of characters that are not considered punctuation. Then I take the original string and turn it in to an array. Then I map over and remove all the punctuation. I reverse the order and map over again and concat the punctuation to its correct place on to the new words. This is done using the punctuationInString array. Since the two arrays will always be the same size you I could simply concat by the index of the word in the array. Trying out a more functional approach to Javascript.
Would be nice to pull the regex in to a variable to make it more readable but not sure how to do this?
https://repl.it/HeEg/3 5function reverseWord (word) {
return word.split(’ ‘).reverse().join(’ ');
}
I’ll tackle the trickier ones tomorrow.My solution in JavaScript:

Create a new array (newStr) that contains only the words of the string in reverse - using a regex to remove the punctuation (non-word characters that are not white-space);
Convert str into an array of words and punctuation only - using a regex to to prepare the punctuation for the split by adding a space before;
Iterate over the str array to look for items that are punctuation - testing each item using .test() with a regex to test for non-word characters;
If punctuation is found in the str array then use indexOf() and splice() to add the punctuation item to the correct index position in the newStr array;
Finally join the newStr array and remove any spaces that come before punctuation (which were added by the join).

function reverseStr(str) {
	newStr = str.replace(/([^\w\s])/gi, '').split(' ').reverse();
	str = str.replace(/([^\w\s])/gi, "" "" + '$1').split(' ');
	for (var i in str) {
		if ((/\W/).test(str[i])) {
			var index = str.indexOf(str[i]);
			newStr.splice(index, 0, str[i]);
		}
	}
	return newStr.join(' ').replace(/\s(\W)/gi, '$1');
}
function reverse(str) {
var words = str.split("" "");
var newStr = words[words.length - 1];
for (var i=words.length - 2; i>=0; i–) {
newStr += "" ""+words[i];
}
return newStr;
};https://repl.it/He07/0 2Algorithm
I decided to first split the string on spaces, giving me an array of words including punctuation. I then loop through half the length of the array to swap words at corresponding distances from the edges of the array (last becomes first and vice versa, etc.)
The swap is done by splitting the two words into “punctuation-words” which are one or more non-alphanumeric characters and regular alphanumeric words. I then use a regular expression to find the index of the alphanumeric word (assumes there’s only one per entry) and swap it with the alphanumeric word in the other end. I then put these pieces two pieces back into the large array where they now have their words swapped, but punctuation is intact.
To make it easier to match alphanumeric words, I assigned a callback function to a variable used for find (word, row 2).
Space Complexity
I do use the array of split words rather than the actual string, not sure what we count as in-place in this case. I could modify the string directly, but string operations are expensive and more complicated than working with an array. My goal was to avoid needing an auxiliary array, which I did.
Inside the for loop at least a temporary variable to store one of the values we’re swapping is required. For readability purposes I’ve declared some additional variables in here.
On a larger scale what I store inside the for loop becomes less important though, especially if the input string becomes larger (which is when complexity becomes relevant).
Time Complexity

Split string, I assume O(n) in javascript, where n is length of string
For-loop running m/2 iterations, where m is length of array
2.1. 2xSplit string, O(w) where w is length of word
2.2. 4xFind, (little more than) O(w) where w is length of word

Read and write to array are constant time operations, so leaving those out of the list. The part I’m not sure about is joins. Given the immutability of strings the time complexity could be closer to O(n^2). Not counting the join we get n + m*(6w)/2 = n + 3m*w ~ n + 3n = 4n, so O(n). Depending on how join works we’ll end up somewhere between O(n) and O(n^2).
https://repl.it/HeUe/2 96This was fun to play with! I have solved it a couple of different ways, including the intermediate difficulty level to handle punctuation, and while I was at it, I also wrote methods to keep the capitalization of the earlier sentence. I also provide a method that only moves punctuation, since that’s what the intermediate difficulty challenge asks for.

42,Already December…any goals?,Random,6,66,"Helloooo 
I can’t believe it’s already December. It’s just crazy. Insane.
I achieved a lot of things in November, coding-related and non-coding related. How about you guys?
And since the last month of 2020 already started, what are some goals you want to accomplish before the year ends?
I want to (and I have to…more like, there’s no way I don’t do it) finish a personal coding project I’ve been working on. That project has taught me a lot about consistency and working hard…and I’m so excited to get a big break after I finish it 
I also want to finish the Designing Databases with PostgreSQL skill path and make some pretty notes about the things I learn 
I have a few other personal goals, but let’s leave it there for me 
What are your goals?My main goal for the rest of the year (and hopefully years to come) is to get more involved in open source collaboration.  As a first step, I recently joined my local Code for America 2 brigade so I can start working on something meaningful.  For me it’s important to work on projects that either 1) I genuinely enjoy; or 2) have greater purpose/impact.  When a project doesn’t fall into either of those categories, I tend to drag it out far too long 
For anyone in the community who lives in the U.S., I highly encourage you to take a look and see if there’s a Code for America brigade in your city or state and see if the projects they are working on spark any interest for you.  Collaboration with others is essential for building your skills as a developer and it’s something I wish I had done earlier in my coding journey.
Plus, you don’t really learn git until you work with other people and have a few minor panic attacks when you accidentally commit a secret key, push to the wrong branch or delete the wrong code resolving a merge conflict I’d like to get up to NLP on the DS path, or, near where I had been before (linear regression). I also want to check out the PostgreSQL path b/c of the data involved (MLB! My favorite).  
Non-coding related…I’d like to start some more crocheting projects and possibly bake a few kinds of Christmas cookies. I ran for the first time since March this past weekend and I need to re-incorporate it back into my weekly schedule. I missed it so much.


 lisalisaj:

I’d like to get up to NLP on the DS path


NLP made me abandon the Chatbots skill path…my brain was so freaking confused 
I think I should give it another try though…maybe next year My goal for the month is to make a couple friends I can talk with about learning coding! I don’t even care to talk in detail about the specific tech, just people to learn along side with. I’d love to have an accountability partner and someone to share the ups and downs with.Oh that sounds great, I barely fit in anywhere so it’s kinda hard for me to make friends lol.
But anyways, welcome to the community! I’m sure you’ll find tons of great people here, wish you the best of luck! My goal is to make more time to continue learning python so I can start making my own projects. I have been quite busy with school and other activities, so I need to find a way to leave time for coding. 
Non-coding related, I do like to learn how to draw and paint better."

44,Is this not for me?,Community,2,265,"I’ve watned to be a programmer for quite a long time, but I’ve always been to lazy to start learning it by myself. I’m about to enter high school so I’ve researched tons of different jobs that I could do in the future (I’m planning to go to college) but programming was the one that suited me the most and that I was really interested in. So quite recently I’ve finally started to learn on here and my first course was Python. Since around 50% of the course (where the reverse challenges started) (I’m at 65-70%) I began to struggle very hard. By now I’m probably getting like 10% of the things right and I just feel like this could just not be something for me. My depression is hitting harder and my hope is vanishing. Since I want to be a programmer, I’m most likely gonna be in class with advanced maths and physics and with all the fails on here, I’m starting to questionate my ability to logically think at all, and I think that I will just get kicked out of the school within first year there (I’m not sure about school systems in other countries, but just know that I’m 16.)
Is there any hope for me to do what I want in the future?
I’m extremely sorry for my english (perhaps that’s the reason I couldn’t learn properly, but I understand big majority of the things and I always have translators to help me so it’s probably just me and my stupidity) and overall cohesion of the text. I’m extremely mad, tired and sad at the very moment but I hope that you understand my problem.
Life is just been a massacre for me lately so just tell me if it’s not for me and I’ll end it all. I can’t stand the constant taste of failure in life.This is a question to take up with the guidance/career counsellor at your school. Nobody here knows you well enough to give anything but generic advice… Hang in there, sort of thing.
If you are experiencing a lot of failure then it may trace back to giving up too easily or expecting everything to be easy. It’s not. Whether it is math, science, programming, writing, history, art, sports, civics, and so on. They are all hard subjects that demand our committment. Never give up.The main thing is not to lose hope, because when you get depressed, it is simply impossible to expect a positive result."

If I’m going to dedicate to making a change and learning a new skill, I’m going to do it NOW.
There’s no need to put it off any longer and I’m just going to go for it!
Currently taking the Python Web App with Flask track and setting reminders for the next 30 days to keep myself accountable. Super excited to learn and keep the momentum going!Best of luck to you Juilian! You got this. Just be consistent and you will reap the benefits and be beyond ecstatic with your end results. Code on  Good luck, I wish I had enough bravery to do that. Just work hard and keep trying and you will do great.Day 2, I’m about 11% finished with my ‘Build Python Web Apps with Flask’ skill track .
Once this skill track is 100% I’ll be doing the Data Analyst career path which will be more intense.Day 3, a few more projects completed, lots learned, about 16% finishedDay 4, learning about lists in Python and how to append items. Not much going on today but still wanted to login and learn a bit to keep the streak going!Good luck @julianperry
Learn, try to get the completionKeep up the great work @julianperry!That’s definitely the goal, would love to learn enough to begin making basic web apps with login/signup functionality and connectivity to a data base to begin storing data. 
Day 5, completed ’ Creating and Modifying a List in Python’ segmentDay 6, Working with lists in Python (tomorrow will be my first week of coding once a day! woo hoo!)Day 7, I’ve made it a whole week coding once a day!
For the sake of keeping things concise, I will no longer be posting a reply here to this thread every single day but I will continue with my 30-day challenge until I see it through to completion . I’m learning so much about Python and would encourage everyone to try the 30-day challenge to push yourselves to learn new things!

I’m about 25% through with my ‘build web apps’ skill path which is an exciting milestone for me to be a fourth done. I feel like the 30 day/100 day challenges help keep me accountable since I would feel sad if I were to not keep the streak going. Every day it clicks in my mind ‘oh wait, I gotta get on Codecademy and keep my streak going!’ even if it’s just one lesson.
Even 1 lesson a day keeps the prior information I learned relevant and on my mind. If I go a week or longer without practicing I’d start to forget what I learned. It’s all about building good habits and staying accountable .Hey Julian,
Nice for you I hope you keep the streak going.
I’m 16% in the backend with JavaScript, I’ll try to finish this course.
little by little we can archive, lets help each other.   This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.25%, that is great process, I hope you can beat it. I have never known anyone who had tried a 100 day challenge, but good luck!I may totally agree with you! I started learning a week ago and I’m trying not to pass any of lessons.So, I understand you completely. I wish you good luck and doing your best to not give up your studying on the halh of the way.

47,[Challenge] Anagram Detector,Featured Challenges and Events,63,17.3k,"#Code Challenge, April 26th 2017
Every week, we feature the type of brain-teasing question that might be asked in a full-stack developer’s job interview, similar to the FizzBuzz Challenge often used at places like Facebook and Google.
For this week’s challenge, inspired by a question reported to have been asked in developer job interviews at Microsoft:

Write a function in your favorite programming language that will accept any two strings 42 as parameters and return “1” if they are anagrams 352 and “0” if they are not.

For simplicity’s sake, focus only on strings composed from uppercase letters (in hex ASCII - from 41 (A) to 5A (Z)) and space characters.
####Scroll down and reply to this thread with your code to participate!  Don’t just submit your code, remember to explain your solution, too!  Please link to your code on a site like repl.it 44 to make assessing your entry easier (see below).

##Extra Credit
####Intermediate Difficulty
If you’d like to go a step further:

Make sure that your answer has no more than O(n + m) time complexity 65, where n is the length of the first string and m of the second.

Make your submission as efficient as possible!  You can presume that the hypothetical interviewer in this case is looking for the most direct approach that does not involve len(n)! permutations.
Learn more about Big O notation and time complexity here 40 and here 18.  There’s also an old (and thus unsupported) Codecademy course on Big O 27, if you prefer.
##The Winners

For the “best entries,” see here!

Though it is now too late for any more submissions to be considered as a “best entry,” we encourage you to submit further responses anyway!  It is our hope 3 not only that you’ll benefit from the experience in testing your skills or preparing for interviews, and your posting your answer here will build up a library of content that will help others to learn too.

###How to participate


Use any language taught on Codecademy (Python 21, Java 17, Ruby 20, JavaScript 15, PHP 3, etc.)


Please include a link to your code running on service like repl.it 44, CodePen 11, JSFiddle 4, or our very own CodeBits 19 so that your fellow students can learn from your submission easier and faster - if we have hundreds of submissions, we may not have time to assess entries that do not have links in this manner


If you want to post your code directly, please make sure that it is correctly formatted 15!


Happy coding!

The fine print:

Remember, the point of code challenges like these is to test and stretch yourself with an unusual problem, so don’t be dissuaded if you find it difficult or don’t know where to start!  Start with Googling, but see if you can find out how to think about the problem and what tools you need to solve it, but don’t just go looking for the solution itself.  This way, it’ll be a better learning exercise for you - developers can’t always find and copy “the right answer” online, which is why questions like these are used in developer job interviews!  Interviewers want to be able to see how you think through problems and not just whether or not you can solve them.
If you are interested in “winning” the code challenge, please don’t use any unusual repos or anything that will make it difficult for us or your fellow users to assess your answer quickly.
Do you have a code challenge to share with other users?  Issue it!  Make a new topic with [Challenge] in the title to open a challenge, maybe we’ll even feature it in our next newsletter!

Hi code community, I’m Roy, a moderator here on the forums. Here’s a sample solution I made last night while we were discussing this challenge. I look forward to seeing your responses too!
https://repl.it/H0vl/6 12
The logic if fairly straight forward, and explained in the comments.
The verbose version is appended for testing, only.
Raw code
def is_anagram(a, b):
  # are they strings?
  if type(a) != str or type(b) != str: raise TypeError
  a = a.replace(' ', '')
  b = b.replace(' ', '')
  # do the lengths match when spaces are removed?
  if len(a) != len(b): return 0
  # are the characters in alpha ASCII range?
  if a.isalpha() and b.isalpha():
    base_wp = sorted(list(a.upper()))
    test_wp = sorted(list(b.upper()))
    while base_wp:
      # do the data points match?
      if base_wp.pop() != test_wp.pop(): return 0
    return 1
  raise ValueError

Usage
is_anagram('JIM MORRISON', 'MR MOJO RISIN')
Solution in PHP
function anagram($first, $second){
	$first_length = strlen($first);
	$second_length = strlen($second);
	$flag = 0;
	if($first_length == $second_length){
		$first_array = str_split($first);
		$second_array = str_split($second);
		for($i=0; $i<$first_length; $i++){
			if($first_array[$i] != $second_array[$second_length - $i - 1]){
				$flag = 1;
				break;
			}
		}
	}
	else{
		$flag = 1;
	}

	print_r(($flag == 0) ? 'Anagram' . PHP_EOL : 'Not an Anagram' . PHP_EOL);
}

anagram($argv[1], $argv[2]);


Updated Solution in PHP to find any rearranged anagrams
function anagram($first, $second){
	$first_length = strlen($first);
	$second_length = strlen($second);
	$flag = 0;
	if($first_length == $second_length){
		$first_array = str_split($first);
		$second_array = str_split($second);
		sort($first_array);
		sort($second_array);
		for($i=0; $i<$first_length; $i++){
			if($first_array[$i] != $second_array[$i]){
				$flag = 1;

	else{
		$flag = 1;
	}

	print_r(($flag == 0) ? 'Anagram' . PHP_EOL : 'Not an Anagram' . PHP_EOL);
}

anagram($argv[1], $argv[2]);

https://repl.it/H2JZ/2 4
Raw Code:
def anagramChecker(word1, word2):

  stripWord1 = word1.replace(' ', '')
  stripWord2 = word2.replace(' ', '')

  sortWord1 = sorted(stripWord1)
  sortWord2 = sorted(stripWord2)

  if (sortWord1 == sortWord2):
    return 1
  else:
    return 0
    
print(anagramChecker('ALEC    GUINNESS', 'GENUINE CLASS'))
print((anagramChecker('PANAMA', 'BANANA')))

Simple solution using Python.  I’m assuming the inputs will be strings with only upper case letters and spaces, so all that is needed is to strip out the spaces and compare the sorted lists of characters, which should be identical strings for anagrams.//Only a beginner. I know I should check for strings, strip out whitespace and punctuation, clean up the submitted data, but for simplicity's sake I'm going to pretend the person submitting is nice. Won't get me a job but it's made me smile.

function anagrammer (str1, str2) {
  
  var tidyStr1 = str1.split('').sort().join('');
  var tidyStr2 = str2.split('').sort().join('');

//array it, sort it, smush it back
  
  if (tidyStr1 === tidyStr2) {
    return ""anagram"";
  } else {
    return ""not an anagram"";
  }
  }

console.log(anagrammer(""lampost"", ""cotton""));
console.log(anagrammer(""angel"", ""angle""));
Your answer  only fits when two words have their letters inversed but not rearranged.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram 13Rails, O(n+m)
def char_frequencies(phrase)
  frequencies = {}
  phrase.split("""").each do |char|
    if frequencies.key?(char)
      frequencies[char] += 1
    else
      frequencies[char] = 0
    end
  end
  frequencies
end

def anagrams?(phrase1,  phrase2)
  char_frequencies(phrase1.downcase) == char_frequencies(phrase2.downcase)
end

def anagrams(phrase1, phrase2)
  anagrams?(phrase1, phrase2) ? 1 : 0
end

Make the comparison case-insensitive by downcasing both phrases.
Use a hash map to track the frequency of each character in each phrase.
Ruby typically returns booleans from functions ending with '?'s, but we’ll add another function that returns a 1 or 0 to meet the spec.
If both phrases have the same characters with the same frequencies, they’re anagrams of each other.
Checking the equality of the two hashes fits our O(n+m) time constraint because it only needs to check all the keys in the hashes, and there are only as many keys as there are characters.// Splitting the strings into character arrays, sorting the arrays, and comparing them.
function stringsAreAnagrams($string1, $string2)
{
    $stringArray1 = str_split($string1);
    $stringArray2 = str_split($string2);
    
    sort($stringArray1);
    sort($stringArray2);
    
    return $stringArray1 === $stringArray2;
}

$string1 = 'anagram';
$string2 = 'granama';
echo stringsAreAnagrams($string1, $string2);
First I checked if the two Strings have the same length, then I try a for loop checking that the i character equals the len-i-1 character.
If there is a character or length mismatch the loop terminates returning false.
And this is my function in Java:
public static boolean isAnagram (String s1, String s2){
        boolean state=(s1.length()==s2.length());
        int len=s1.length();
        for (int i=0; i<len; i++){
            if (state){
                state= (state && (s1.charAt(i)==s2.charAt(len-i-1)));
            }
            else break;
        }
        return state;
    }
Solution in Javascript (certainly not the more efficient but it’s working):
https://repl.it/H2ou/1 9
Don’t know about the complexity of this Here is my solution in python. I hope it covers intermediate problem as well.
def isAnagram(s1,s2):
	# init dictionary for storing chars and their counts (has O(1) for set and get)
	myMap = {}

	# count of distinct characters
	chars = 0

	# going through string 1 (s1)
	for ch in s1:
		if ch not in myMap:
			# if current char is not in dict, add it with value 1 and inc. chars value by 1
			myMap[ch] = 1
			chars += 1
		else:
			# if current char is in dict, add 1 to its number of occurences
			myMap[ch] += 1
	
	# going through string 2 (s2)
	for ch in s2:
		if ch not in myMap:
			# if current char is not in dict (from string 1), char is new and therefore return 0
			return 0
		else:
			# if char is in dict, substract 1 from its number of occurences
			myMap[ch] -= 1

		if myMap[ch] == 0:
			# if number of occurences in the current string is for the char the same as in the s1, substruct 1 from number of expected chars
			chars -= 1

		if myMap[ch] < 0:
			# in case of number of occurences of the char in s2 is greater then s1 return 0
			return 0

	if chars == 0:
		# if all chars has been used in both strings equaly return 1
		return 1
	else:
		# some chars has not been used in s2, so return 0
		return 0

UPDATE 1: Added comments to the codeImproved PHP solution stripping spaces and using a lambda for dryer code.
function stringsAreAnagrams($string1, $string2)
{
    $stringToSortedArray = function ($string) {
        $stringArray = str_split(str_replace(' ', '', $string));
        sort($stringArray);

    };
    
    return $stringToSortedArray($string1) === $stringToSortedArray($string2);
}

https://repl.it/H2jv/0 1Hi, here is my solution in JavaScript.
I’m sorry if my english is malformed somewhere, but it is not my native language.
This works by looping one time through both strings. Inside this loop I collect the number of occurrences of each character on each string. I collect these counts in two arrays, one for each string. In these arrays the indexes correspond to the char codes, and the values correspond to the counts.
After the loop I compare the two arrays and if they have the same count for the same characters, the strings are anagrams.
I’m assuming the strings will only contain uppercase letters and spaces.
function isAnagram (string1, string2) {
    // These arrays will collect the counts.
    var arr1 = [], arr2 = [];
    var i = 0;
    // One loop to traverse both strings.
    // This loop will run n times, where n is the length of the longest string.
    while (i < string1.length || i < string2.length) {
        // It could happen that 'i' increases beyond the length of one of the two strings so first I check if there is a character at this index in the strings, and if this character is not a space. If it is a space it will just jump this character.
        if (string1.charAt(i) != '' && string1.charAt(i) != ' ') {
            // Then I increase the count for this character in the corresponding array.
            // The first time a character occurs I asign 1, the next times I increase 1.
            if (arr1[string1.charCodeAt(i)]) {
              	arr1[string1.charCodeAt(i)] += 1;
            }
            else {
              	arr1[string1.charCodeAt(i)] = 1;
            }
        }
        // Do the same for the other string.
        if (string2.charAt(i) != '' && string2.charAt(i) != ' ') {
            if (arr2[string2.charCodeAt(i)]) {
              	arr2[string2.charCodeAt(i)] += 1;
            }
            else {
              	arr2[string2.charCodeAt(i)] = 1;
            }
        }
        // Increase 'i'
        i++;
    }
    // After the loop I compare the two arrays, and if they have the same counts for the same characters, the strings are anagrams.
    i = ('A').charCodeAt(0); // Get the char code of the character 'A'
    while (arr1[i] === arr2[i] && i <= ('Z').charCodeAt(0)) {
     	  i++;
    }
    // After the loop if 'i' has increased beyond the char code of 'Z', all the counts were equal.
    return (i > ('Z').charCodeAt(0) ? '1' : '0')
}

Happy coding!
~CC modsHere’s my entry, using pure Javascript.  My thinking is that each word or phrase is really just a set of letters, and two anagrams have matching sets of letters.  My function arranges the letters so they can be compared, and then sees if they are a match.
var is_anagram = function(str1,str2){
   str1 = str1.replace(/\s/g,'').toUpperCase().split('').sort().join('');
   str2 = str2.replace(/\s/g,'').toUpperCase().split('').sort().join('');
   if (str1 === str2){
   //It is an anagram!  Return 1
   return ""1"";
   }else{
   //It's not a match.
   return ""0"";
   };
};

On each string:

remove whitespace with regex
convert to uppercase
split into an array to make it possible to sort
sort the array (alphabetically)
convert back to a string (because it’s harder to compare arrays without looping)
After this process, strings that are anagrams should produce the same string.  If the produced strings don’t match, then you don’t have an anagram.

My working example is here: https://jsfiddle.net/clintongalloway/cfb0Lhxc/ 2
I just saw that you prefer this so I took a few seconds to upload this https://repl.it/H2oZ/1 5Hi everyone,
Here I present you my Python code for solving the challenge so you can read it and test it yourselves. Right after it you will find a brief explanation on how the code works and how I came up with it:
https://repl.it/H2tf/4 5
So, if you have looked at the code you would have noticed that the most substantial part is contained in the  anagrams function, which contains the logic that can tell if two strings are anagrams in O(n+m).
In order to be able to comply the time complexity constraint I assumed that both input arguments satisfied the precondition of being strings composed of uppercase ASCII letters. Then, if I wanted to accomplish the time complexity goal, I knew that I needed to iterate each argument one time at most. So, I came up with this idea of iterate over the first string and count the occurrences of each letter, and then iterate over the second string while trying to “undo” the counting I did before. This way, if the strings were actually anagrams, all my letters counts would be zero by the time I had finished iterating over the second string, and I wouldn’t have found any letter apart from the ones I encountered in the first string.
So, if we inspect the code of the anagrams function you will see that basically I use a dictionary for counting the letters occurrences. The first for loop is where I define each letter from the first word as a key in the dictionary, and I increment its value as I see them along the string:
for letter in first_string:
        letters_count[letter] = letters_count.get(letter, 0) + 1

Later on, in the second for loop, I walk through each letter of the second string and I retrieve from the dictionary its number of occurrences:
    for letter in second_string:
        occurrences = letters_count.get(letter, None)

If that value is higher than 1, then I decrease it and store it back, as I already managed to match a pair of the same letter in both strings:
if occurrences > 1:
            letters_count[letter] -= 1

Otherwise, if that value is exactly 1, that means I have just matched the last occurrence of that letter in the first string. Hence, I remove the letter from the dictionary as I shouldn’t be expecting to encounter this letter again while I finish my second string iteration.
if occurrences == 1:
            letters_count.pop(letter, None)

Lastly, if that value is None, it means that I have found a letter that I cannot match to an occurrence of the same letter in the first string. Therefore, I can immediately conclude that the strings are note anagrams and return False:
        if occurrences is None:
            return False


By the end of the loop, if no keys are left in the dictionary (meaning that I was able to match each letter from the second string with a letter from the first string and no letter from the first string remained without match), then the words are anagrams. Otherwise, they are not.
return True if not letters_count else False

On top of that, I defined a validate_string function that runs some checks to the guarantee those assumptions I made for the anagram function inputs, and it raises some custom made exceptions in case one of those checks fails.
Then I assembled both of the previous mentioned functions inside a wrapper function called anagram_detector, which also is responsible for translating the boolean value returned by anagram into a 1 or 0 accordingly.
Finally, I added some tests cases and an interactive routine that allows the user to run the whole test suite or just type in a pair of strings for detecting if they are anagrams.
Well, that is all about the code. I hope you liked it or you find it useful.
Thanks for reading it 
–
Carlos.function isAnagram(word1, word2){
   var word2Arr = word2.split("""");
   for(var letter of word1){
        var index = word2Arr.indexOf(letter);
        if(index == -1){
            return ""0"";
        }
        word2Arr.splice(index,1);
   }

   if(word2Arr.length == 0){
       return ""1"";
   }else{
       return ""0"";
   }
}

The function isAnagram takes two arguments: word1 and word2.
Then word2 gets spilled into an array of charactes called word2Arr. Then word1 gets looped through. Each letter gets queried in the word2Arr array. If a match is found, that letter gets removed from the word2Arr array. If a match is NOT found, it means word1 contains a letter that word2 does not, and is thus not an anagram of word2, and returns “0”. Once the loop has finished, the length of word2Arr is checked. If all the characters have been removed (an empty array), it means the word is an anagram and “1” is returned.My solution in Java
import java.util.Arrays;
class Input{
    static int find(String x, String y){
        String s1=x.replaceAll(""\\s"","""");
        String s2=y.replaceAll(""\\s"","""");
        boolean state=true;
        if(s1.length()!=s2.length()){
            state=false;
        }else{
            char[] s1Array=s1.toCharArray();
            char[] s2Array=s2.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(s1Array);
            Arrays.sort(s2Array);
            state=Arrays.equals(s1Array,s2Array);
        }
        if(state){
            System.out.print(""Anagrams"");
            return 1;
        }else{
            System.out.print(""Not anagrams"");
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
class Anagram{
   public static void main(String...s){
       Input.find(""TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE"",""I AM LORD VOLDEMORT"");
   }
}

Following steps are involved in the code:

Remove the white spaces using Regex
Convert the Strings into character arrays
Sort the characters in the array
Use the equals() method to check for matches
Return “1” if they are anagrams and “0” if they are not anagrams

48,What music do you listen to when you code?,Random,58,705,"I’m jamming out to Pat Metheny.
I always listen to jazz.I listen to a mix of old timey music, jazz, and modern pop. Some lofi as well. I usually listen to movie scores 
This one 13 in particular helps me focus A LOT, probably because I feel like I’m doing something really important I listen mostly to country and Christian, though I also like music by Thomas Bergerson and Lindsey Sterling.
Welcome to the forums @burnedfaceless!! I, too usually have my local Jazz station, WBGO on (quietly) in the background or one of the several jazz channels on google music (read: McCoy Tyner, John Coltrane, Ray Bryant, Monk, Harold Mabern, Horace Silver, etc.)
Silence is also good too.Nice! You have good tastes in jazz.Just discovered this yesterday.  Didn’t know Jazz/Bossa covers of Studio Ghibli songs was a thing.

I’ve had mixed successes with background music whilst trying to concentrate.
I either tend to go for some chilled house music, or some specific artists/albums that I’ve found to be good at “background”.
A good example of the kind of music I mean is this:
Opeth - Windowpane (Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire, London)
I mainly listen to Powfu, Beababoodoo, Ed Sheeran, and sometimes Avicii (out of both tribute and respect).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A 2 Amazing relaxing beats by ChilledCowBeen listening to playlists on youtube. Lately it’s been some Black Sabbath and Dio playlists. But currently listening to an 80’s sing along playlist.
But if something’s really concept heavy, and can’t handle words in the background my go-to’s are:

— Yoona I listen to a lot of instrumental stuff, esp. film score. Anything with lyrics distracts me. 
There are a lot of fantastic instrumental tracks on YouTube by indie artists one would never find otherwise.  As far as genres go…I listen to a lot. Film score and folk are my favorites, although instrumental metal does occasionally make it in. And electronic. And classical. Like I said, lots of different genres.Like listening to modern-day pop, or Beethoven. My favorite songs from both styles would be Moonlight Sonata and Borderline (ft.Missy Elliot)).For me i listen to instrumentals from Yanni and Kenny Rogers. I as well love songs from Enya, Jon Bellion, Passenger as wellI listen to dank lofi beats. (a big twoset fan, i find the brett & eddy ones realxing)"

The thing is that today I had to pay my landlord the money and my card got declined, when I checked my ballance I saw that a big chunk of my rent money went to the subscription again…I wasn’t notified before this no mail no phone call, nothing. Just boom, money gone. Now, how can I apply for a refund? I mailed them on contact but still didn’t answer. On the website they say that they don’t do refunds. I am really scared because I was already late with the rent and my landlord is mad at me. I need my money back so I can go another month without getting kicked out.

Hopefully they can help you out!Hey @mattliv this person needs our help, it looks like!Hey, I actually did mail them before opening this topic. Uhm…maybe I should just give them some more time to answer given the reason that they stated I need to wait up to 48 hours for an answer. I think it’s just the panic of the moment that made me try every way possible to solve this :-/. I am really sorry, I know it’s on me and I should have remembered.Thank you very much for the fast notice, I already made a ticket on contact before opening this topic, I was just really panicked at that moment and just wanted to try all the ways. I will wait the 48h period as stated and hopefully next week it will be solved and I can pay the landlord. Thanks you again, and sorry for causing the trouble :-/ I know I should have remembered earlier to deactivate the auto subscription, I will read things more carefully next time I will do something like this.For those that wonder, the codecademy staff was very fast and promt in dealing with my issue.

50,[Challenge] Flatten an Array ♭,Featured Challenges and Events,37,12.2k,"Code Challenge #21: August 30, 2017
Every week, we feature the type of brain-teasing question that might be asked in a full-stack developer’s job interview at places such as Google and Facebook.
This week’s challenge was reported to have been asked in interviews at Facebook and has also been asked right here at Codecademy!

Basic Difficulty

Write a function, flattenArray, that when given an 2D 67 array, flattens it into a 1D 21 array



Function Name: flattenArray


Input: a 2D array

Output: a 1D array

Example: flattenArray([1,2,3, [4,5], 6, [7,8], 9]) => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Always remember to explain your code and the thought processes behind it!
You can think of a 2D array as a spreadsheet or a chessboard, whereas a 1D array is more like a list or one long chain of data.
What if your interviewer had follow-up questions or extensions to this challenge? Don’t anticipate what exactly those follow-ups or changes may be, but try to write your code so that it is easily read, easily maintained, and can be adapted to potential modifications in the interviewer’s questioning.

Find out more about basic challenges.
You can learn more about arrays with some JavaScript exercises here 61, here 8, and here 7.

Intermediate difficulty

Improve on the flattenArray function by writing flattenArrayN, a function that can flatten arrays that are nested n-levels deep, returning a flattened 1D array.



Function Name: flattenArrayN


Input: any array with n levels of depth, where n is an integer ≥1


Output: a 1D array

Example: flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

For our intermediate challenge, the array can have multiple types: {}, [], """", undefined, null, and integers (1,2,3,…) are all valid types inside the array.
You must explain your submission to be able to win!

Here is my submission in Python 3,
for both the basic and intermediate challenges:
def flattenArray(my_nest):
    # my_nest is a list, possibly nested, to ONE level
    my_flat = [] # initially empty, result list
    for my_item in my_nest:
        if type(my_item) is list:
            # if we have a list, then extend the result
            # with the item, an assumed flat list
            my_flat.extend(my_item)
        else: # otherwise append to the result, one item
            my_flat.append(my_item)
    return my_flat # now flattened list
    
def flattenArrayN(my_nest):
    # my_nest is a list, possibly nested, to ANY level
    my_flat = [] # initially empty, result list
    for my_item in my_nest:
        if type(my_item) is list:
            # if we have a list, then extend the result
            # with a recursively flattened list
            my_flat.extend(flattenArrayN(my_item))
        else: # otherwise append to the result, one item
            my_flat.append(my_item)
    return my_flat # now flattened list

print(flattenArray([1,2,3, [4,5], 6, [7,8], 9]))

print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]))

I use a Python list to hold an arbitrary array.
For flattenArray I assume, at most, one level of nesting.
I  make use of the list function extend,
which adds the “contents” of a list to the end of another list.
Essentially, performing a single flattening, in the process.
For flattenArrayN I  allow for any reasonable depth of nesting.
The code is very similar, except that a recursive call is necessary.
Here is the output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

And here is the link:
https://repl.it/K8op/10 41Python 3.6 -
I have created this function to check if an object is array or not, which is used below
def isIterable(anyObject):             # O(1)
    if hasattr(anyObject, '__iter__'):     # Check if the object has __iter__ attribute to consider it an iterable
        if not len(anyObject):         # if the iterable is not blank i.e. length is greater than 0, return true
            return True
        elif len(anyObject) > 0:
            # if iterable is not checked infinite times like string, return True
            if not next(iter(anyObject)) == anyObject:
                return True
    else:
        return False

Basic Challenge :
def flattenArray(inputArray):      # O(N)
    flatList = []
    for item in inputArray:        # Loop over every element(array or not) in the array
        # If the element is nested array, join it with output flat array
        # else just add the element to the flat array
        flatList += item if type(item) is list else [item]
    return flatList

print(flattenArray([1,2,3, [4,5], 6, [7,8], 9]))

Output :
flattenArray([1,2,3, [4,5], 6, [7,8], 9]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Intermediate Challenge :
I had few different ideas to solve this challenge.
This one is quite unique and it does the job but unfortunately I am unable to find its Big O notation, so who knows it may the fastest way to flatten an array.
def flattenArrayN(inputArray):
    # from string representation of list, remove all brackets which represent arrays to make the list one dimension
    arrayString = str(inputArray).replace('[', '').replace(']', '').replace('{', '').replace('}', '').replace('(', '').replace(')', '').replace(',', ' ').replace(':', ' ')
    # get list of all elements
    list_ = arrayString.split()
    flatList = []
    # Since all the elements are string, convert them back to their original data type
    for element in list_:
        try:
            flatList.append(eval(element))
        except:
            flatList.append(element)
    return flatList

print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]))

In this solution, every loop flattens nested list(two dimension list). The total number of loop depends on the maximum dimension.
def flattenArrayN(inputArray):     # O(N*d) where N is number of elements of array and d is the number of dimensions of the array
    flatList = inputArray
    arrayFlattended = False         # to keep check on progress
    while not arrayFlattended:      # loops over array d times
        arrayFlattended = True
        list_ = flatList            # iterate over previously flattened list
        flatList = []               # current list
        for element in list_:
            if isIterable(element):  # if the element is an array, append all elements with the current list
                for innerElement in element.items() if type(element) is dict else element:
                    # if the array is dictionary, append its key, value pair else append the elements of the array, which will be flattened in the next loop if they are also array
                    flatList.append(innerElement)
                    if arrayFlattended:       # If no nested array found yet, check if the current innerElement is an array of not
                        if isIterable(innerElement): # If the elements of nested list are also array run the loop again to flatten it
                            arrayFlattended = False
            else:
                flatList.append(element)
    return flatList
    
print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]))

# Working -
# [1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]
# [1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This solution uses recursion. Instead of flattening the whole list dimension by dimension, just flatten each nested list recursively.
def flattenArrayN(inputArray):       # O(N+s) i.e. O(N) where N is the total number of elements in the array and s is the sum of number of elements of nested arrays(sum of all k), here N >= s
    flatList = []
    
    for item in inputArray:          # Iterate over the input array, O(N)
        if isIterable(item):         # check if item is an array
            # Join nested array(recursively flattened) with outermost array
            flatList += flattenArrayN(item if type(item) is not dict else item.items())      # O(k), where k is number of elements in nested array
        else:
            flatList.append(item)

    return flatList

print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]))

All the intermediate solutions have same output except first one as it does not change string elements
Output :
flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Hard Challenge :
This is my hard entry to the challenge again using recursion in which every element is appended to a list(which is 1D) by recursively getting into every nested list at a time.
def flattenArrayN(inputArray, flatList=0):   # O(N+d), i.e. O(N) where n is number of elements in input array(including only 2D arrays and not arrays nested in 2D arrays) and d is the dimension of innermost array
    if flatList == 0:      # if no argument is given initialize the array
        flatList = []
    for item in inputArray:          # Iterate over the input array, O(N)
        # Append elements of nested arrays recursively
        if isIterable(item):        # If the object is iterable, it is considered array and flattened
            if type(item) is dict:        # Different way to flatten dictionary than other arrays
                for pair in item.items():       # item.items() return an array of tuples containing key,value pair which is again recursively flattened
                    flattenArrayN(pair, flatList)
            else:
                flattenArrayN(item, flatList)
        else:
            flatList.append(item)
    
    return flatList

print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]))
print(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, [5, [6, [7, [8]]]]]], 9, [10, 11, [12, 13, [14, 15, [16, [17, [18, [19, [20]]]]]]]]]))
print(flattenArrayN([(1, 2, [3, {4, 5}], {6: 'seven'}), 8, 9, {10: 11}, [[{12}]]]))


The only significant difference between the two solution using recursion is that intermediate solution joins recursively flattened lists with final 1D list whereas hard solution appends elements from each nested list to final 1D list.
Output :
flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, [5, [6, [7, [8]]]]]], 9, [10, 11, [12, 13, [14, 15, [16, [17, [18, [19, [20]]]]]]]]]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
flattenArrayN([(1, 2, [3, {4, 5}], {6: 'seven'}), 8, 9, {10: 11}, [[{12}]]]) => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 's', 'e', 'v', 'e', 'n', 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

https://repl.it/KfPl 4
EDIT ==> I have adjusted my solutions to flatten arrays of different types.Easy, Intermediate, and (possibly) hard explained below:
//Easy:
const flattenArray = (arr) => {
	let flatArr = [];
	for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		if (Array.isArray(arr[i])){
			for (var x = 0; x < arr[i].length; x++){
				flatArr.push(arr[i][x]);
			};
		} else {
			flatArr.push(arr[i]);
		}
	};
	return flatArr; 
}

console.log(flattenArray([1,2,3, [4,5], 6, [7,8], 9]))
//returns [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Pretty straightforward- the function loops through an array. It determines if item i is itself an array. If so, it runs an inner loop and pushes the sub-item x into a new array. Otherwise, item i is pushed into the array. (Note, I explain below why I used a second array instead of modifying the existing array in-place)
The intermediate function basically does the same thing, but takes it a step further using recursion:
const flattenArrayN = (arr)=> {
	let flatArray = [];
	let loopAgain = false;
	for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		if (!Array.isArray(arr[i])){
			flatArray.push(arr[i]);
		} else {
			for (var x = 0; x < arr[i].length; x++){
				flatArray.push(arr[i][x]);
			};
			loopAgain = true;
		};
	};	
	if (loopAgain) {
		return flattenArrayN(flatArray);
	} else {
		return flatArray;
	};
}

console.log(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6])); 
//returns [1,2,3,4,5,6]

In this function, the “easy” loop process from above runs, but this time adds a loopAgain variable that sets to true if the loop runs into an array item i. So, just like before, the loop iterates over array item i. If i is not an array, i gets pushed into a new array flatArray. Otherwise, an inner loop runs and pushes sub-item x into flatArray, and loopAgain is set to true. Once out of the outer loop, if loopAgain is true, the function calls itself recursively on flatArray and runs the same test, until all items checked are not arrays, and loopAgain is false.
Edited to add: here’s an attempt at optimizing the Easy challenge, also added to the repl.it link:
const altFlattenArray = (arr) => {
	let flatArray = [];
	flatArray = arr.toString().split(',');
	//now every item is a string, so convert numbers back to Number
	flatArray.forEach(function(item,index){
		flatArray[index]=isNaN(Number.parseInt(item))? item: Number.parseInt(item);
	})
	return flatArray;
}

This time, the array is only iterated once (after being split and then joined again, removing the single-nested arrays), instead of multiple passes like in the above easy function. I added the check to see if parseInt() returns NaN in case the original item in the array was already a string before .toString() was called. If so, just return the original string, otherwise convert the number string back to a number.
And another way to accomplish the easy challenge:
const flat2DHard = (arr)=> {
	let flat2D = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6].reduce(function(acc,cv){
		return acc.concat(cv);
	},[])
	return flat2D;
}

Here, as above, the function only makes one full pass through the array to flatten it, instead of multiple loops. However, the above function allows for any data type in the 2D array, since all it does is .concat() the individual items.
Link to repl.it showing matching output: https://repl.it/K9R9/0 7Your function runs in time complexity of O(n*d) where n is the number of elements in the outermost list and d is the maximum number of dimension i.e. number of nested arrays inside outermost array which means it loops over outer most array for d times and everytime a nested array is flattened, no. of elements is outermost array increases. Your solution using recursion is a good one but can’t say its very efficient    My first time participatin in a challenge here. My submission is in Ruby an for the Basic and Intermediate levels.
def flatten_array_n(array)
  target = [] # Create an array to store the extracted values.
  array.each do |v| # Iterate through the array
    if v.is_a?(Array) # If the value is an array flatten it recursively (to account for deeper levels)
      target.concat(flatten_array_n(v)) # Then append each value to the target array
    else # If it's anything other than an array, append it to the target array
      target.push(v)
    end
  end
  target # Return
end

puts flatten_array_n([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]).to_s

 star3lord:

Your function runs in time complexity of O(n*d) where is the number of elements in the outermost list and d is the maximum number of dimension i.e. number of nested arrays inside outermost array which means it loops over outer most array for d times and everytime a nested array is flattened, no. of elements is outermost array increases. Your solution using recursion is a good one but can’t say its very efficient    


Cool, thanks! Still getting my head around complexity theory, and based on your reply, I definitely see how my solution can get pretty expensive pretty quickly.This is my submission in Javascript.
It calls the function recursively in order to flatten any nested n-levels deep arrays.
This is the code 13:
function flattenArrayN(arr, newArr) {
  //Loop through the array
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    //If the element is an object, recursively call the function
    //to flatten the arrays that are nested n-levels deep
    if(typeof(arr[i]) === 'object' && arr[i] !== null) {
      flattenArrayN(arr[i], newArr);
    } else { //Otherwise, add the element to a new flattened array
      newArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return newArr; //return the flattened array
}

//Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, """", undefined, null, 7]
console.log(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6, '', undefined, null, {}, [], 7], []));

//Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
console.log(flattenArrayN([1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6], []));

 //Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(flattenArrayN([[[[[1, 2]]]], 3], []));

//Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
console.log(flattenArrayN([1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6, [7, 8], 9], []));

//Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
console.log(flattenArrayN([1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 6, [7, 8, 9], 10, [11, 12, [13, 14, 15]]], []));
This is my first time participating in a challenge! My submission is in Python3 and is for the intermediate (and possibly hard) challenge:
from copy import copy

def flattenArrayN(list_in): #list_in is the list we wish to flatten
    list_out = copy(list_in) #adjust this until we get desired result
    j = 0 #iterates through integer labels of list_out
    while j < len(list_out):
        if isinstance(list_out[j], list) == True: #checks if a given element of list_out is a list
            temp_list = list_out[j] #result[j] is a list, make a copy of that list
            for s in temp_list[::-1]: #goes through elements of temp_list from right to left
                list_out.insert(j+1,s) #adds s directly after list at element j
            del list_out[j] #after removing elements of list in list_out at j, remove the list
        else:
            j += 1 #if list_out[j] is not a list, move on to the next element
    return list_out
    
#test run:    
k = [1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 6]
print(flattenArrayN(k))
print(k) 

Here’s how it works. We first make a copy of the input list and call it list_out. We go through each element of list_out and check if that element is itself a list. If it is not a list, we move on to the next element. If the element is a list, we replace that list with its contents and repeat the process starting from the first new element. The way we replace that list is to go through its elements starting from the right, and insert them ahead of the list. Once we go through that whole list, we delete it. After going through all of list_out, we return it. Here’s an example to illustrate the process:
[1,2,[3,4,[5]],6]
-> [1,2,[3,4,[5]], 3,4,[5],6]
-> [1,2,3,4,[5],6]
->[1,2,3,4,[5],5,6]
->[1,2,3,4,5,6]
Here is a link to the code: https://repl.it/KbV3/3 7
I think a neat modification of the code would be to allow the user to only partially flatten an array. For example, if the input array is 5 dimensional, the user could decide if the output array is 4, 3, 2, or 1 dimensional.Given N dimentional array - A.
Elements of A can be:

items to be flattern - L
N-1 (or less) dimentional arrays - N

Consider A as a tree, where root of that three is the pointer to A.
Then L - are leafes, and N- are nodes of our tree.
To flattern A we should traverse tree in deep and collect all leafes. Recursion and Stack are most simple ways to traverse a tree. I have choose Stack as more ‘controllable’ method, and because in Python we have a great tool for saving traversing context in stack - iterators.
All uncertainties isolated in subroutine inside function. Modifications can be done to add or skip , () elements, to deal with string like objects, etc.

This recursive function creates a new array, flattens nested lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries, and simply adds all other type elements into the new, flat array. Simple, but probably not very efficient. The structure of dictionary is being completely flattened, but keys and respective values are placed next to each other in the resulting list.

I’m searching for firsthand experiences from people who have successfully acquired employment/reliable income from development/coding as a result of non-traditional education. I have read of other’s success, however I do not want to assume I am correct about any of this without putting forth the effort to thoroughly research it myself. If you have time I would like to know:
What type of development and language did you start out studying?
What type of development and language did your first job entail?
Where were you able to network with others like yourself and those already working professionally?
What resources did you find the most helpful?
Did you have any experience with boot camps, coursera, udemy, or other structured systems?
With your experience, what would you stress the most to someone starting out?
Did you ever freelance?
How long did it take to land your first job?
I have a steady job at the moment however, I feel I owe it to my family to provide better for them. My Wife and I have a 4yr old daughter and twin 11month old boys. I thought that, due to the pandemic, remote positions would be more attainable by someone starting from scratch. I enjoyed a few courses I took in college of C++ and am intrigued by python and swift. I don’t expect to find a silver bullet, I simply can not waste time studying something that no employer cares about and wouldn’t benefit me when faced with real world situations. I’d like a remote position, I would think that such jobs would go to someone with senority in a company normally, but with the pandemic I thought it may become more common.
Also, if I were to choose one type of formal option to take online, what would suffice most requirements? If a bootcamp would work I’d rather not spend the time on a master’s out of my field.
To anyone who can, I would greatly appreciate your time and concil. If you would prefer not to reply here, you can also email me at feedback.council2020@gmail.comMost of your questions have already been discussed (see links below) but here are some answers:


Don’t focus too much on what other people learned, what worked for them will not necessarily work for you. Following someone else’s path will most likely lead to frustration


Best places to network are here, the Discord channel, local or virtual meetup, conferences


This forum is one of the best resources you can have. Yes, there are other places but you’re already here!


You will not find a job after finishing a bootcamp or taking a course here, it just doesn’t happen, You need A LOT more experience. If you pick this path, it will take a long time before you can land a job. It’s rewarding, but it’s not easy.


You will not be a successful freelancer after finishing a bootcamp or taking a course here. You can be a freelancer, but you will not be successful, it is WAY harder than starting a job as a new coder.

53,Reflecting on 30 Days of Coding,30-Day Challenge,11,1.1k,"This space is for sharing about your 30-Day Challenge. 


You finished the 30-Day Challenge! What did you learn?
Finished HTML and CSS. I’m 82% of the way through JS. It’s a doozy.
Since I’m new to coding in general it takes a lot of focus and rereading to have some of the concepts sink in. Currently on the promises lesson, and it’s taking some deep focus to understand.
However, I have created a basic HTML website with some CSS styling and a little bit of JS just to use the projects in a real world environment.
Also, I’m staying engaged with the React lesson as well. Overall, I’m pretty pleased with my progress. I think I might be best served by going back and really mastering some of the previous topics. Repetition is needed now.I’m gonna go ahead and put this up here, finished my 30 days while back and started another recently. As to the internship, I’m having an interview on Wednesday! I’m super excited/worried, and I’m sure this helped prepare me for this.
Thanks CodeCademy! Congratulations!!! What languages have you learned that you feel helped prepare you most for the internship? I’m nearly done with the Web Development path, but I don’t feel very confident in my own skills yet so I’d love some advice!Oh, congrats on almost finishing the Web Dev path, it’s quite the endeavor! I’m so curious, what would make you feel more confident in your skills, you think?Hey @kgnunn999!
I found that knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (especially the DOM side of JS) was very helpful and I would recommend advancing your experience in each of those languages (at least for a front end job). I’d definitely recommend trying to build your own websites. This will make you run into problems that you won’t know how to fix and so for sure advancing your knowledge.It was great up until I got to OOP and Inheritance.I am doing great I have just completed the 30days challenge. I did 30 minutes session every day. I feel I learnt a lot along the way but I am still not so comfortable with the language I’ll put more efforts on the next challenge.Woo-hoo I’m on day 30!! That went by so fast… and it’s incredible how much I feel like I’ve learned. Today, I’m working on the hurricane analysis project in python. Although I need to take some time to think about what I’m doing, the program seems to be doing what I tell it to do. (for the most part, at least… some corrections here and there)
30 Days ago, I was learning how to assign integers and strings to variables, and today I’m writing a program that loops through a dictionary to create another dictionary. THIS IS SO COOL.
It would be foolish for me to not start another 30-Day Challenge. I’m on day 23 and it’s great I like the challenge of learning everyday and actually look forward to every session. Here’s what I’ve learned in my 46 years on earth. If you work hard at it and work in a way that works with your style of learning, over time you will learn. This is the sixth time in my career I’ve had to retrain myself. Having faith in yourself is key and having patience in the learning process. Keep at it and it will happen. Be well! I am about 50 days in.  I forgot to do my 30 day reflection.  It feels good to make progress in Python.  My interests with Py has extended now into machine learning, ai, and some financial applications.  As a profession math tutor I continue to remain interested in some of the cryptography and computational mathematics problems.  I am looking forward to integrate and synthesize more code with mathematics, extending some unfinished projects.
There is still a lot to learn – up to the modules section and exploring the vast libraries and modules one can import to enhance code.
One reflection that has come up several times is, “what is ethical use of technology?”  More specifically, is coding being used for legal, and humanitarian purposes, or is it being politically weaponized and or appropriated without our consent to weaponize an institution or state?  This reflection has led me to reflect deeper about the history and momentum of technology, ai development, government, politics, economic power, and international security.
What has come up is the question, ""What is it like to think about coding from a more human rights law perspective that seeks to enhance diversity in government, educational leadership and improving economic development, not just create greater tech gaps as we have witnessed with the big 5 tech companies?  More specifically, where do human rights discussions in light of technology come into play with not only the need for physical security, but now, also cyber security and stronger data protection?  Where does code come into play as a corrective force when technology is being used for illegal purposes, like surveillance without our knowledge or consent?  Can we use and develop code and communities of code to raise awareness for human rights principles?  And what can one do in light of diminished privacy concerns in this increasingly connected and technocratic age?  Can good judgment and leadership (not just technical know-how) exist in code more synthetically?  Can we keep certain bad actors without oversight more accountable with better code through more sophisticated diplomacy?Hi all!
I hope you are all enjoying your coding journey! I certainly am! I have also completed the 30-Day Challenge, currently 61% through the Web Development Path. I have some experience with Python and am pursuing a career in full-stack development. I am enjoying the front-end development side more than expected.
I have learnt:
HTML; used for the structuring of a webpage. Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the elements opposed to div. I can build tables and forms. layout documents with appropriate white space, to provide ease of reading.
CSS; provides limitless styling of webpages using selectors and properties. CSS allows me to add colour, font stylings, positioning and display properties. Flexbox allows for responsive web pages that react to resizing of the web browser window.
JavaScript is a programming language that provides webpages with logic. This script allows users to interact with webpages. Some new concepts introduced to me were asynchronous functions, promises, await, and requests.
I have also learnt to think about errors in a different way. I now have a methodical approach to debugging instead of the panic that used to set in when seeing the red text. I am more comfortable using the command line. Learnt how to use Git and make commits to GitHub, I look forward to using these skills more in the future.
I am currently learning JSX, which is an interesting blend of JavaScript and HTML. I am enjoying the Codecademy content, the projects are well explained and are at the right level.
I am going to start my next 30 Days now. Coding every day helps to “rewire” your brain. Helping you to access the skills required to learn a new language and solve problems. My next course after Web Development will be jQuery.
Happy Coding!"

In my experience, most websites that teach touch typing are pretty similar. By using any one of the sites you listed, you should be able to learn to touch type."
57,What was your win this week?,Random,14,240,"Hello!
What was your win for the week? (It can be coding related or not!)


Did you/do you have a coding streak?


Did you finish a project?


Did you try out a new recipe in the kitchen?


Excited to read about everyone’s win! I have a 13-day coding streak on the DS path (and data analyst paths).
I get up pretty early and my brain works better then so I’ve been going through the data science path.
(Also, shout out to whoever wrote the section on functions. It was the clearest explanation that I’ve ever encountered! I had written them/used them before but was not 100%. The cc explanation was the one that has made the most sense to me, by breaking down each part of a function. So, thank you!!) BIG win in the kitchen for sure! I tried making Döner chicken kebabs at home using my oven and they came out fantastic! It all starts with the marinating 24 hours prior, with a yogurt base and a bunch of spices like cumin and cayenne pepper. Don’t forget the squeezed lemon of course, then… then I’ll just share the recipe  here 3.It’s so gratifying when you figure out a recipe. Good on you! I’ve got a 16 day streak going!! Best I have had in awhile and hoping to keep it going.
I got to use a live IDE to help someone out with their Python project.
And after a good bit of extra work there are chickens in the backyard, give it a few weeks and we will have fresh eggs  16! Woo! 
Oh, wow, neat!Dumb question, but, what kinds of chickens? Breed(s) I mean.
I watched some chickens hatch on an instagram account I follow & it was really neat to witness. They were the all-black chicken breed, I forget their name. Though, you won’t have any hatching…unless you have a rooster too?They are called Easter Egg chickens due to the fact they lay green and blue eggs.
They should all be hens, but they aren’t old enough for us to tell for sure.
The DNA test they do is supposed to be 95% accurate.I’ve got a decent streak going but sometimes that’s just two lines on that particular day so I’m jealous of anyone who’s maintained a streak with a little more consistency and doubly so if that includes excellent kitchen wins and homegrown chicken eggs.
For me, code learning has been plodding along steadily with plenty of little wins but nothing major. I think mine for the week would have to be on the bike. Been annoyed by some very subtle ticking but only ever on the lowest gears (checked the chain, cassette and everything inbetween). Eventually found a loose spoke ever so gently brushing the cassette, which led me to a dent in the rim, which led me to find the entire wheel was askew. So I’ll call it a win that I caught that now before it collpased on me way out on a trail somewhere .

On the upside, you get to go shopping for shiny new bike parts! (I managed to deform my rear wheel… somehow, no idea how. New set of Mavic’s on now, and it’s smooth riding again.)
My win was also kitchen related, in that I managed to successfully scratch-make hollandaise sauce (first attempt) for a salmon and spinach pie. Bonus was there was hollandaise and spinach left over, so after a quick trip to the store the following day there was eggs benedict for breakfast.

61,Last Group Focus Session tomorrow (10/30/2020)? :*(,Corner Bar,13,146,"I know I previously posted 1 about how I wasn’t as sad about losing Group Focus sessions (like the one tomorrow 1) since learning about Codecademy Chapters.  Turns out, I actually am sad because I think tomorrow’s the last focus session 
I’ll try to make it to tomorrow’s focus session… these sessions been a great way to meet others & be productive in a coding project or lesson.  I’ve attended these sessions a couple of times to try to make some progress in the Data Scientist Career Path.
@lilybird I’m hoping decisions have changed about focus sessions & I’m wrong about tomorrow being the last session  Tomorrow is still the last session, and I really hope you can join us, @webdevholland!  We may have someone taking it over going forward, though!  I will be sure to update the crew if that happens.Group focus sessions are back and now hosted by your fellow Codecademy learners!

Fede, Lisa, and Pedro (NYC 1) will be hosting a focus session every Wednesday at 1pm EST!Hey, @webdevholland. How’s it going? This is Dharma. I and my friend, Carlos,(we actually met in these focus sessions. Can you believe it?) used to attend these focus sessions and we were gonna miss them, same as you. So, I talked with Lil if there was something we could do about it and here we are! With a new Chapter and the same old Focus Sessions! I have set up the event page for this week’s focus session. Did you join it yet? Here’s the link to the focus session 2 if you haven’t RSVPed yet and here’s the link to the chapter 2. Feel free to look around!  And if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me! or @lilybird. I’m sure we’ll be able to help you out!Hey Dharma,  thanks so much for reaching out! Lil did mention the Focus Bytes chapter to me… I’m so happy that both your chapter & the NYC chapter will be continuing focus sessions!
Things have been a little hectic for me, but I hope to get back to joining focus sessions again in the next week or two. I’ll keep in mind this Friday’s session hosted by Focus Bytes… thanks again for the invite! 
ChristineAwesome. Hope to see you there soon! @webdevhollandHey all,
I assume that those focus sessions can be the thing for me.
Could you please describe what’s the procedure during a session like that @goku-kun?
Thanks in advance!
/KostasHey, @konstantinosr23. I hope you’re doing well. The first focus session is being held this Friday,  27, Nov, 2020 at 12pm EST. I’ll be the one hosting it and you should totally join in!
The process in these sessions is:

We meet and greet, introduce ourselves and our goals for the focus session that we’ll be working on.
We go into our focus time where we work on these goals individually with no distractions.
We come back and then discuss if we were able to achieve our goals and then wrap up the session.

They are super fun to attend and I have gotten a lot of work done this way.

62,[Challenge] Unique Characters in a String,Featured Challenges and Events,260,89.0k,"Code Challenge, April 19th 2017
Every two weeks, we feature the type of brain-teasing question that might be asked in a full-stack developer’s job interview, similar to the FizzBuzz Challenge often used at places like Facebook and Google.
For this week’s challenge:

Write a function that determines if any given string 426 has all unique characters 186 (i.e. no character in the string is duplicated).  If the string has all unique characters, print “all unique”.  If the string does not have all unique characters, print “duplicates found.”

Scroll down and reply to this thread with your code to participate!  Don’t just submit your code, remember to explain your solution, too!
Don’t worry if someone has already posted the solution you had in mind, this should be a fun challenge for you, so why not write it up and post it anyway, or consider doing something for extra credit?

Extra Credit
Intermediate Difficulty
If you’d like to go a step further:

Don’t use any additional data structures.

Make your submission as efficient as possible!
The Winning Entries

See our favorite submissions (and why we picked them) here.


How to participate
Though this challenge has now “ended” in the sense that we have chosen our favorites, you should feel free to post your own response!  Just make sure that your code is correctly formatted 254.
If you do want to try this, why not stretch yourself a bit further and try this challenge in a language that you don’t know well, or a language that isn’t as well suited to this sort of task as the likes of Python? Or go for a solution that is off-the-wall, a very unusual (yet interesting and artful) way of solving the problem that is likely not maximally efficient? You won’t necessarily stand a better chance of “winning” this way, but it will help you to push yourself if you need something more challenging.
Happy coding!

The fine print:

Remember, the point of code challenges like these is to test and stretch yourself with an unusual problem, so don’t be dissuaded if you find it difficult or don’t know where to start!  Start with Googling, but see if you can find out how to think about the problem and what tools you need to solve it, but don’t just go looking for the solution itself.  This way, it’ll be a better learning exercise for you - developers can’t always find and copy “the right answer” online, which is why questions like these are used in developer job interviews!  Interviewers want to be able to see how you think through problems and not just whether or not you can solve them.
Please don’t use any unusual repos or anything that will make it more difficult for your fellow users or Codecademy staff to assess your answer.
Do you have a code challenge to share with other users?  Let us know!  Make a new topic with [Challenge] in the title to open a challenge, maybe we’ll even feature it in our next newsletter!



 Solved by oduffy in post #253 


                Wow, thank you all for so many contributions to this challenge!  Given how popular this series is becoming, we decided to issue a new challenge every week, so check back in every Wednesday for more! 
On to “winners,” with special thanks to our crack team of @moderateurs (especially @factoradic)! 
We…
              
Here’s how I read the question: Make sure there are no duplicate characters in a string. Hopefully, I read that right. If I did, here’s what I did:
I’ll be writing this in Python as my Java knowledge is limited. I may edit in a Java version at some point.
My first thought was this: a counter. That bit was obvious. I would also need a way of checking for all of the letters. After some research, as I didn’t know the right way to check for duplicate letters, I found the .count() function being used and worked from there. It would return an int that was equal to how many times the letter occurred in the string.
I thought “Ok, I’ll need to end it with an if statement obviously”.
Based on that I decided on how I would write the program.
I would set an array with the full alphabet and run a for loop that went through each letter and ran .count() for that letter on the string. If it occurred only once in the string then I would just continue the loop, if it occurred more than once then I would add the amount of occurrences to the total. I could then use the total variable, after the for loop, in an if statement. If the total was greater than 0 (as it had been added to), then duplicates had been found.
However, if it was equal to 0, then no duplicates were found and all letters were unique.
I also ran .lower() and .replace("" "", “”) on the string so that capitalization didn’t affect it and spaces weren’t counted as duplicate characters, just as a precaution.
This was to be my algorithm.
I set to writing the code and came up with this, but it wasn’t the final solution:
letters = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""


def Checker(string):

    string = string.replace("" "", """").lower()

    total = 0

    for l in letters:
        count = string.count(l)
        if count > 1:
            total += count

    if total > 0:
        print(""Duplicates found."")
    else:
        print(""No duplicates found."")


Checker(""string"") # Returns ""No duplicates found.""


After some thinking, I realized that this isn’t exactly efficient as it goes through every letter in the alphabet despite the fact that some letters won’t be in the string. I optimized the code so that it only checked the letters in the string, and not the whole alphabet. This is my complete code:
def Checker(string):
    string = string.replace("" "", """").lower()

    total = 0

    for l in string:
        count = string.count(l)
        if count > 1:
            total += count

    if total > 0:
        print(""Duplicates found."")
    else:
        print(""No duplicates found."")


Checker(""string"")

This also gets rid of the unnecessary letters array.
You can run some unit tests by simply changing the string in the parameter of the function call.
This code is simple, relatively efficient (there is probably a more efficient method out there somewhere), and looks elegant.
Hope you like it!
Thanks Oops: I thought the FizzBuzz challenge was the challenge for this fortnight! Never mind, here goes for the duplicate letter challenge. I did this in Java to test myself a bit more, as it’s not my strongest language.
It’s interesting to think about the big-O for this solution. In the end, we have to carry out sequential comparisons until we get a match, so this has to be a O(N^2) solution. My first thought was to use an array of chars: as soon as one already exists, then the game is up. In pseudo code this would go something like
  if (myChar in arr) then found=true else arr.push(myChar)

but that is hiding a sequential search that gets longer as the array gets bigger, so it’s still really a O(N^2).
In any case, the challenge was to avoid using any new data structures. Therefore, it is easiest to compare letters pairwise and make sure we can short-circuit as soon as a match is found.
The other problem is defining “duplicates”. Do spaces count? Case significant? What about accents: e, è, é and so on? For simplicity, I have settled on a simple toUpperCase comparison, but it could be make as complex as you like!!
Here is my code:



class DuplicateLetters {

  private static final String DUPSFOUND = ""duplicates found"";
  private static final String NODUPS = ""all unique"";

  private static boolean sameLetter(char s1, char s2) {
    return (Character.toUpperCase(s1) == Character.toUpperCase(s2));
  }

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    String s = args[0];
    Boolean found=false;

    System.out.println(s);

mainloop:
    for(int i=1; i<s.length(); i++) {
      for (int j=0; j<i; j++) {
        if (sameLetter(s.charAt(i), s.charAt(j))) {
          found = true;
          break mainloop;
        }
      }
    }
    System.out.println(found ? DUPSFOUND : NODUPS);
  }
}


Hope you like it!
Tim FHi,
I’ve been coding in python for about a year or so, mainly self-taught.
Here’s my first function:
def char_checker(text):
    if len(text) == len(set(text)):
        print('all unique')
    else:
        print('duplicates found')



Updated with an explanation.
def char_checker(text):
    '''check to see if there are repeated characters in text'''

    # Find the number of characters in the given text string
    num_char = len(text)

    # Find the unique characters in the string
    # set(iterable) iterates over the parameter to make a set.
    unique_char = set(text)

    # Find the number of unique characters in the string using
    #  properties of set datatype
    num_unique = len(unique_char)

    # If the total number of elements in the text equals the number of
    # unique elements in the text, then there are no repeated values.
    if num_char == num_unique:
        print('all unique')

    # If the number of elements doesn't match, then there is a character
    # that appears in the text more than once.
    else:
        print('duplicates found')



In python, a set is an unordered list of unique items. So no matter how many times an item is listed when you define a set, it is only listed once as an element of the set.
>>> s = {1,2,2,2,4,5,6,9}
>>> s
{1,2,4,5,6,9}
>>> s
{2,5,1,9,4,6}

Above, I defined a set and then called it twice. Note how the order of the elements of the set changed.
Based on the comment by @nstublen, I came up with something completely different.
Since I want to end this as soon as I find a duplicate value, I don’t want to act on the entire string if it can be avoided.
I start by looping over the characters in the sting. The next step is to see if the character occurs more than once.
Here I’m using a try-except setup. Try is a cool feature that performs a task that could fail but doesn’t break the program. You can add except conditions to handle specific errors.
The method str.index(str, beg=0 end=len(string)) locates a substring inside a string and returns the starting position of the substring. beg and end are optional features defining a portion of the string to be searched. I nested my method to so the search starts immediately to the right of the the position of the first occurrence of the substring (inner index call). If the substring is present, the method returns the position. If it is not present, the method returns ValueError.
If char is present the a second time, it will have a positive position which triggers the conditional and reports that there are duplicates and exits the function.
If the char is not present, the ValueError gets raised and we pass or do nothing.
A cool feature of for loops I saw on a YouTube video is that an else condition can be added to the loop if it runs through all of its values. So if the loop covers all of the characters in the string without finding a duplicate, it triggers the else condition and reports that there are no duplicates.
def unique_char(text):
    '''check to see if there are repeated characters in text'''
    for char in text:
        try:
            if text.index(char, text.index(char) + 1) != -1:
                print('duplicates found')
                return
        except ValueError:
            pass
    else:
        print('all unique')

-StoddardThis is my solution for this problem in javascript:
var letters = ""abcdgefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"";

function checkLetter(string) {
    var strLength = string.length;
    var arr = [];
    for (var i = 0; i<strLength; i++){
        var subStr = string.substring(i,i+1);
        
        if(arr.find(function(letter) {return letter === subStr})){
            console.log('duplicates found.');
            return;
        };

        arr[i] = subStr;
    }
    console.log('all unique');
    return arr;
}
var result = checkLetter(letters);

But I am just learning It yet.Since I, not long ago, found out how set() in Python works, it was the first thing I tried:
def is_unique(s):
  return str(set(s)) == s

But since sets are unordered, and other minor reasons, this didn’t work. Then I thought it through and realized I didn’t need it to be ordered, just the same length, therefore:
def is_unique(s):
  return len(s) == len(set(s))

If it’s stupid, but it works, it ain’t stupid. And just to get the print:
print('all unique' if is_unique('Codecademy') else 'duplicates found')

I’m mostly self taught and I’d like if someone could tell me what a “data structure” is, thanks.Hello, first time submitting a solution so here we go.
Taking into account the ‘Extra credit’
We can use string splicing to compare a single character of a string to all other characters of the same string.
Put that inside a for loop that goes through the entire length of the string and voila! This assumes the need for case sensitivity which could easily be fixed either the .upper() or .lower().
This will also count whitespace as a character.
test_string = input(""Enter a string to test for character uniqeness : "")
unique_test = True
for i in range(0,len(test_string)):
    if test_string[i] in (test_string[:i] + test_string[i+1:]):
        unique_test = False
        break
if unique_test: print(""all unique"")
else: print(""duplicates found"")
Maybe I misread but why cant you just use a regular expression to handle the check. I did this with javascript. And I have edited this to just expand more on my answer.
the regular expression allows me to set the format/constraints I want to test against then I can test against it using the test function. This will return a boolean that I then alert to notify the user of the test result.
var str=""psdssda"";
var stringCheck = (/([a-zA-Z]).*?\1/).test(str)        
alert(stringCheck);
I decided to try out both the easy solution and the intermediate solution, i.e. without any additional data structures.
1. Easy solution
def unique_ez(str):
    return len(str) == len(set(str))

Since a set can only contain one of each element, converting the string to a set will eliminate all duplicates. If the original string has the same ammount of elements as the set with duplicates eliminated, then there are no duplicates.
Since insertion into a set has an average time complexity of O(1) (according to Python Wiki 5), this solution should have time complexity of about O(n), where n is the length of the string. (len(str) should also take linear time).
2. Intermediate solution
Here I’m not allowed to use a set or a list (if I understand the question correctly), so here’s how I did it instead.
def unique_hard(str):
    str2 = """"
    for c in str:
        if c in str2: return False
        else:         str2 = str2 + c
    return True

I introduce a second string, and iterate through each character in the string. If the current character’s in str2, it means there’s a duplicate, and thus we can exit the loop early to avoid doing any more work. If not, we add it to str2 and proceed to the next iteration. If at any point, the same character appears again, c in str2 will return true this time meaning the duplicate has been detected.
Obviously the time complexity’s a bit worse here. c in str2 takes O(m), where m is the current length of str2. The value of m in each iteration of the loop will be 0, 1, 2, … n, since it increases by 1 each iteration. Since c in str2 takes O(m), if we add all iterations, it will take O(0+1+2+…+n) = O(n(n+1)/2) = O(n^2).
Not sure how string concatenation works in python since strings are immutable, so perhaps str2 = str2 + c reduces performance even further.
Here’s the entire code:
def unique_ez(str):
    return len(str) == len(set(str))

def unique_hard(str):
    str2 = """"
    for c in str:
        if c in str2: return False
        else:         str2 = str2 + c
    return True


string = input(""please enter a string to test:\n"")

if unique_hard(string): print(""all unique"")
else:                   print(""duplicates found"")
 
@ross.rawlins It’s at the right track
In Java I’d do something like
interface DuplicatedCharacterTester {    
    public static final String DUPLICATED_MESSAGE = ""duplicates found"";
    public static final String NON_DUPLICATED_MESSAGE = ""all unique"";

    static void test(String s) {
            System.out.println(
                 s.matches(""([\\w])*\\1"") ? DUPLICATED_MESSAGE
                    : NON_DUPLICATED_MESSAGE
            );
        }
}

It’s pretty simple, just check if it matches a regular expression.I chose to do this in JavaScript, mostly because that’s what I’m learning right now.
I thought about a couple different ways of doing this.  At first I thought about transforming the string into an array where each index of the array was a single character using string.prototype.split() and then iterating through the array with either nested for loops or by using array.prototype.splice() and then array.prototype.indexOf() with the spliced value.  These both worked but didn’t seem terribly efficient with all the transforming and extra variables.
After working on it for a bit a settled on a process where I would leave the string in tact and leverage string.prototype.indexOf() and string.prototype.slice() to do the heavy lifting.  For those unfamiliar  string.prototype.slice() accepts either 1 or 2 inputs.  If only 1 input is given it returns the contents of the string including and after the index of the inputted value.  If 2 inputs are given it returns all the contents of the string between the indices of the two inputted values.
Using these methods i settled on a algorithm where, using a for loop I would start with the first character in the string and check to see if there was another of the same character in the string using indexOf().  If no index was found, which is signified by the return of -1 then I would move onto the next character in the string and search for the same character in the rest of the string.  I would no longer need to look at the previous characters because I had already compared them against the rest of the string, which means that with each pass the search area gets smaller and faster.
I would continue this up to the next to last character because using this algorithm the last character has already been compared to every other character in the string and it could only be compared against itself (which is not useful).
""use strict"";

let myString = 'abcdefghhijklmnopqrst';

function findUnique(string){
	for (let i=0; i < string.length -1; i++) { 
		if (string.slice(i+1).indexOf(string.slice(i,i+1)) != -1) return 'duplicates found';
	}
	return 'all unique';
}

console.log(findUnique(myString));
I wrote in in JS, it works fine I guess.
Here is a link to my solution:
my code 35
function parse(){
    var input, testingStr, result;
    input = document.getElementById('myText').value;
    
    if (input.length <= 0) {
        document.getElementById('target').innerHTML = ""enter a string"";
        return;
    }

    testingStr = '';
    result = 'all unique';
    for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i ++){
        if (testingStr.indexOf(input[i]) > -1){
            // in other words return false
            result = 'duplicates found';
            break;
        }
        else {
            testingStr += input[i]
        }
    }
    // in other words return true
    document.getElementById('target').innerHTML = result
}

I get the user input > first thing I make sure it is not an empty string > then I create a testing string to keep track of the already tested characters > matching every char with the already examened string > if a match found I stop the loop and print the result ‘dup found’ if I got to the end of the loop I print ‘all unique’.
End of my story 
It feels for me as the stright forward answer, although I am sure there are many approaches.
Would like to hear comments.My easy solution (though I like @coreblaster87817’s solution better):
def dup_check(s):
    l = []
    for character in s:
        if character in l:
            print(""duplicates found"")
            return
        l.append(character)
    print(""all unique"")
    return

Pretty self-explanatory. It takes a string, initializes an empty list, iterates over the string checking each character against what is already in the list. If the character is already in the list, print “duplicates found” and return, otherwise, append the character to the list. If it gets through the entire string print “all unique.”res = ""all unique""
for c in txt:
    if txt.count(c) > 1:
        res = ""duplicates found""
        break
print(res)
Here is my own approach. My code is java.
I used the toCharArray function of String class to “pick” each character of the string. This way I was easily able to compare chars of each string to check for duplicates using a for loop. Here’s my code
void testString(String theString)
    {
        boolean duplicatesFound = false;
        String s = theString;

        char[] c = s.toCharArray();


       for ( int i = 0; i < c.length; i++ )
       {
          for (int j = i + 1; j < c.length; j++)
          {
              if (c[i] == c[j])
                  duplicatesFound = true;
          }
       }

        if (duplicatesFound)
            System.out.println(""duplicates found"");
        else
            System.out.println(""all unique"");

    }
First implementation that came to my mind after tinkering with Python REPL for a minute:
def test(s):
   for letter in s:
     if s.count(letter) > 1:
       print(""duplicate found"")
       return
   print(""all unique"")

Step by step:

Iterate through every letter in the string
Check if the count of that letter is more than 1
If it is print “duplicate found” and return from method
After iterating through the string and finding no dupes print “all unique”

I guess that’s what the challenge is about - finding a simple working solution fast.var testString = ""codecademy"";
var flag = false;

function IsStringUnique(_string){
    for(var i = 0; i < _string.length; i++){
        var letter = _string[i];

        if(_string.slice(i + 1).indexOf(letter) != -1){
            console.log(""Duplicates found. The letter: "" + letter);
            flag = true;
        }  

    }
    if(!flag){
        console.log(""All unique"");
    }
}

IsStringUnique(testString);

The string ‘codecademy’ gets passed to the function ‘IsStringUnique’.
The function then loops over every character of the string, which is possible because a string is just an array of characters.
For every iteration, the following happens:

The current letter gets assigned to a variable called ‘letter’.
The parameter (‘codecademy’) gets sliced,  removing the current letter from its array.
The letter variable (in #1) then gets looked up in what remains of the parameter after it got sliced. If a match is found (not a -1 position):
i. The letter gets logged to the console.
ii. A global variable called flag gets its value changed to true.
After the for loop completes, the value of flag gets checked. If it’s still false, the message “All unique” gets logged to the console.
The following is my solution. Unfortunately I didn’t think about using the .test() method.
function uniqueOrNah(someString){
	var newObj = {};
	for(var i = 0; i < someString.length; i++){
		var curStr = someString[i];
		if(newObj[curStr] == null) {
			newObj[curStr] = 1;
		} else {
			console.log('Duplicate found')
			return;
		}
	}
	console.log('No duplicates')
}
Using “set” function in python, you can find unique characters in a string. Compare the length of the result from set(string) to len(string) and you can determine if there are duplicates. Here is the code.
def is_unique(string):
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] in string[i + 1:]:
            print(""duplicates found"")
            return
    print(""all unique"")
    return

is_unique(""teststr"")

63,Happy birthday to me :D,Random,23,243,"I remember the younger me being so hyped up for turning 16 (I thought I would become such a cool person…). And here I am today, turning 16. Pfft.
I never thought I would experience a global pandemic, or that I wouldn’t be able to go out on my birthday. But I’m thankful I live in this time.
Off to celebrate by making all my family watch my favorite movie with me  
Anyways, I don’t know why you’d want to know all of this but 
Have a nice day everyone Happy Birthday!!  
It’s nice that you get to spend your day with family too!
What movie are you making them watch?
Did you make a cake or did they? A baker should have a day off. 
 Thank you so much 



 lisalisaj:

What movie are you making them watch?


Into the Spiderverse (you guessed it, it’s a spiderman movie). I’ve seen it so many times but I never get tired of it 
My little brother says he can know what’s happening in the movie by just listening to it

Did you make a cake or did they? A baker should have a day off. 


Hehe, yep. Well, I’m actually not going to have a cake 
I’m gonna make crepes with my Dad Happy Birthday! Happy birthday @yizuhi, have a nice day!Happy BIRTHDAY!!!

what is that ??
like where’s the picture? where’s the gif?
or video youtube
it doesnt explain or show us anything
where should can we actually start learning?
cos this link page told us aboustley nothing and we still have no idea how to code or anything
seems like filler content, empty unhelpful content
it uses this word ‘HTML’ so many times on this time and yet showed us abosutely nothing…
abosutely nothing

‘Learning HTML is first step in creating websites’
if its the 1st step why isnt it at the very beginning ?? it has all this clutter, who can make this better
where to send feedback so they fix this ?i put this
<p font-family=""Arial"";>
dont work
why?

it’s only showing 1 way to ‘style’
where to find all the ways? where on web?

for example what if we wanted to change all visited links on a page to a color?

also
want a slim fast track way to learn w/e this html thing is
only very basic things of html
looking for source where you learn ONLY basic things of html
extremly confusing
so can learn css fast alreadyThis is the very first exercise in the course. It is expected that it will provide a brief overview of what will be covered in the course, not teach you the entire course in one exercise. It takes time to learn anything, HTML included. Navigate through the course as it was intended to be followed and you’ll have a decent understanding and ability to write HTML by the end of it.

Where do you see this? This isn’t on the exercise.




 dev1374330969:

You’ll learn these in later lessons. You need to understand what HTML does, its syntax, and more basic components of the language before you delve into more complicated topics.




 dev1374330969:

It’s not unhelpful at all. You need to first understand why you’re using HTML, its capabilities, and its applications. Without knowing an object’s purpose, it’d be like learning to use a computer without knowing what a computer is used for.

Progress through the course exercise by exercise, module by module (press the “Next” button). Without an understanding of the basics, how can you understand complexities?

for example what if we wanted to change all visited links on a page to a color?


a:visited { color: purple }
doesnt work

where are we suppose to put it?
does the other code matter or it dont matter ? we can just put anywhere?
if can put anywhere then why doesnt it work
whats diff between a:visited  + :visited ?
what links shows us the difference and what they do exactly speicficaclly exactly
what link shows us all basics of a:visited  + :visited  so that we can actually use it

this part section should be in css not html ?We are given that there are three static document types being imported into a single namespace. That’s the memory where all the magic happens. The HTML formulates the DOM, the CSS populates it with style properties, and the JS lays in wait to spring forth with user triggered behaviors, apart from those that went into the page load.
If we find that last statement confusing, then we need to step back. If needs be, right to the very beginning and start over with a fresh view.
The browser. That’s what we’re composing for. Every device is equipped with one. What’s more the technology has evolved to omit the browser and merely use its scripting engine in apps, along with its HTML and CSS APIs for the UX.

 bit5006033412:

Soft skills are really important. Make sure to mention that. But don’t just say “I’m a very nice guy”. I believe you, but not everyone will. Anyone can say that about themselves. Present it with examples.
Also, what’s your stack? Do you specialize in anything? Are you a full-stack dev? Front-end? Back-end?
Do you have a Github account with projects to show employers?



 bit5006033412:

I might not be the best programmer but what junior dev is


That’s right. Don’t mention this, though. Say you’re hungry to keep learning, every day.
With that comes another problem. If you apply to 20 different places, you’ll most likely just send out a “template cover letter” that doesn’t necessarily align with company X, Y or Z.
The underlying problem is that employers don’t want to waste time and money on someone that will get some training with them and then move elsewhere after a year or two. Thus you must show that you’re familiar with the company you’re applying to, understand what they do, how they work, their culture, their values, and sprinkle some of this information in your cover letter. This is like Tinder but for work relationships. There’s got to be a match. Both you and the employer must feel like there’s a match. Tell them how you’ll be a great match for them. And show long-term commitment.



 bit5006033412:

I am about to give up and move on


Don’t. Do you really want this? Then fight for it. You might even want to consider getting another job while looking for your dream job. Or consider freelancing. There are plenty of places such as Fiverr, UpWork, TopCoder, Communo, Dice,… offering jobs that would help build your portfolio. Also, if you’re looking in your area, but can’t find a job there, consider remote work. That’s the future anyway.
Last, consider that this might be a tough time to find a job. Millions have already lost theirs. Employers might be more careful with their current spending. But things will get better. Just persevere.
All the bestHey there thanks for your reply.  So if you give me some sort of contact I will give you my resume.  So I have had two interviews in the past two weeks both fails.  I completed the test code but they moved on with another applicant.  I apply on indeed, flexjobs…
I have totally struck out when it comes to getting paid freelance.  That is an art in itself and I would love to know how to do that.  With my skill level I just dont think its possible.
There are way to many drag and drop website builders out there so Im kinda lost on how to market myself?
As for fiverr and these types of sites great idea but do people make a living.  I sold a John Elway card for 100 dollars today but I only had one John Elway, if you catch my drift.Unfortunately, this business is very rough. A few years ago I had 7 years of experience as a QA Engineer, I was  applying to 3 or 4 jobs a day for weeks and no call backs, the few interviews I managed to land went no where. In my experience it doesn’t matter how nice you are or how much experience you have, if the company doesn’t think you’ll fit in then you’re not going to be considered.
Why don’t you fit in? Sometimes they’re looking for a leader, sometimes they’re looking for someone to just do what they’re told and not ask questions. Sometimes they’re looking for someone who requires no training and can start working immediately. It’s hard to tell, but if you don’t fit what they want you’re out.
Here’s what you can do to maximize your chances:

have someone review your resume, also have a cover letter handy (public libraries can help with this)
keep networking
keep applying to every job you want
keep attending as many meetups as you can
join a hackaton or coding challenges
develop projects on your own to get more experience
talk to staffing firms. Staffing firms do most of the hard work for you, you tell them your story and they talk on your behalf. They already have relationships built with companies so they put in a word on your behalf, sometimes they provide training to help you have a better chance. IF they get you a job they take a cut for a while, but it’s better than nothing.

While freelancing is an option, it is complicated and requires knowledge that as a beginner you most likely don’t have. It also means you have to be a good marketer, salesman, designer, and project manager. It also requires a decent investment, because you’re not getting paid as soon as you land a job.   I considered this myself, it’s a lot more work than you would think. It’s not impossible, but it’s not easy.Do you have a website, or portfolio of work? Maybe add a video intro of yourself but don’t make it lengthy, just an intro, ~2 min. then you can direct people to your site.
Also, I would leave out your personal Instagram and FB accounts. Neither of those have anything to do with work or potential work. What I mean is have a separation between personal/private and work.
As for your resume and cover letter, there are companies out there that will re-write them for a fee. Just do a google search. I had this done a few years ago and was impressed with the person who re-wrote my resume b/c they were in my field, so, they knew what to say.
Also, when applying to jobs it might be helpful to use something like a word cloud generator to see if you have enough key words from the job post contained in your resume.
ie: copy and paste the job post in the world cloud generator and then see if those words are in your resume. If not, add them strategically b/c ATSs check to see if key words/phrases are in applicant resumes.Thank you for trying to help, I appreciate you all.  I have gotten better with my resume and came up with a kick ■■■ cover letter.  Still no job but I had an interview with Fema and he really liked me and also a startup in California where I passed the coding test and waiting on a response,  wish me luck.  Thanks for the positivity its helping!Thank you so much.  The positivity is outstanding on here.  I actually might get hired by Fema brother doing IT work.  Its not a developer position but a foot in the door.  Your right getting a programmer job is the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do.  I have had a couple of interviews and passed one coding test.  Thanks for the support you guys are helping me along.  I was down in the dumps but I am slowly gaining confidence.  Ty again!Good to hear. Another way you can move up is by starting in support, that is what we do in our company. I currently have a Jr QA member that came up from support, his end goal is to be a developer. At the moment I’m teaching him to do QA Automation, but he sometimes fixes small bugs in our project. It takes a while, but it’s another option.All really great responses, do keep us updated on your search will be great to know where you end up!
To add my own thoughts to the great stuff that has been said:

100% look at what values the company has and make sure you tailor your CV to highlight that you have the same qualities and values.
In an interview never say “I am X” without justifying it. Look up the “STAR” format, if you are asked a question justify the answer using that format.
If you are unsuccessful somewhere, ask them why! Lots of times companies will be able to give you feedback on what you could improve on.
Make sure you have an active GitHub account which shows off some personal projects. If there are any open source projects that you could contribute to through GitHub even better.
Lots of entry level positions don’t actually care how well you can program at all. You could literally not now how to use a computer and they’ll hire you. What you need to do is look up programming interview questions online, these test how well you can problem solve. Being able to explain to someone how to solve these problems, without actually typing them out, will help loooaaddss. Also look up Project Euler to give you some bonus challenges to practice.

And as others have said keep at it! You’ll get there eventually, even if you have to pick up another job to pay the bills, keep pursuing your dreams.
Good luck!Hello everyone sorry I have not got in touch in a while.  So I still have not received a job and certainly down on my luck.  I have lately been doing a ton of responsive design and I am still trying to land my first Upwork client. I am never going to give up. I think I found what I am best at though.  I really like the artistic nature of responsive design and what you can do with all sorts of media queries and that type of thing.  If anyone has any advice of how to get work when it comes to this please let me know.  I feel very stuck still.Thanks so much Alex.  Darn its just so frustrating not working as a junior developer.  Like you said some companies dont even care how good you are they look for certain qualities though.  I wanted to tell ya I have been studying a ton of responsive design and feel my forte is making mobile and desktop sites look amazing with responsive design.  My only question is people are telling me there are going to be no more jobs in website design because of sites like wix.  what do you think about this?Wix is a horrible. (I say that from a user standpoint).
There will always be a need for software engineers.I never said software engineers I was saying coders who like to simply put together some html, javascript, css.  The days for these people are over.  I am mad I have wasted so much time in this while I should of been learning Java, kotlin and other things.There definitely still will be a role of Web developers, people hate wix. Any serious company will not be using it, and even if they are using something else like WordPress, Web developers are needed to customise it.
So there definitely will still be a need.
Do you have a portfolio website showing off your sites?@ghostlovescore, @peachesmotorsports and anyone else that can help. I am currently enrolled into codecademy and building my way through the courses. I have my sight set on working towards becoming a cloud architect, but any back end or maybe front end work would work until I get there. I am 30 years old, I am currently Active duty Military. I’m a careerist but due to the changes in the work environment and other factors that have led me to the decision to leave.  My question(s) is, What certifications do I need and where do I get them? and what are the prospects of me finding a job with Amazon or Google? what steps do I need to take?I order to be a successful cloud architect you don’t need to work for Amazon or Google, is there a particular reason you are focusing on those 2 companies? Many companies nowadays need a cloud architect, finding a company that has a good working environment and pays well is the real challenge.
If your end goal is to be a cloud architect, having a strong background in backend services will be better than the front-end. Not saying that front-end experience is useless, but the backend will be better because you’ll be managing said services so focus on that. As for certifications, you shouldn’t focus on those. Some companies require them but the fact that you have a certificate doesn’t mean you can actually do the job. I’ve interviewed several people that have a certificate but don’t really have the experience or knowledge needed. My DevOps engineer has no certificates, but he is very curious and driven so he learns on the job on his own.
While you’re taking the courses, get yourself a copy of the following;

AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (Exam Guide) -> you can ger this certificate if you really want one
The Kubernetes Book, Nigel Poulton
Terraform: Up and Running, Brikman

Read those and start playing with clusters. You’re going to need a good knowledge of Docker and a decent machine to set up local clusters. My Macbook Pro has 16GB of RAM and it struggles when I enable the Kubernetes local cluster, I also have a lot of stuff open though but still, it doesn’t work for me. If you want to make a small investment in yourself, you can actually sign up for a personal AWS account and create things there, the commands are the same but you can also play with the IAM roles, EC2 instances, S3, buckets, etc.
Good article to read. 1
This is something I’ve been meaning to do for myself to offload the demand on my system running everything locally, I just haven’t had the time to do it. 2
Things I recommend you learn\master along the way:

git (branch management, strategies, pipelines, runners, environments) -> there are many tools for this: Gitlab, Github, Jenkins, etc.
bash
Docker
AWS services (EC2, S3, serverless functions, dynamic resources, etc.) -> note that a lot of companies use AWS, but if you really want to make yourself marketable you should also learn the equivalent for Google and Azure. Heroku is another option, I haven’t explored their services in a while but they have a free tier you can use to minimize costs
nginx
REDIS
databases (SQL, NoSQL, any flavor) -> setup, backup, backup strategies, restore, ETL, performance testing
Istio
monitoring (Grafana)
QA strategies (focused on the environments and deployments)
security (roles, permissions, best practices, testing) -> you’ll be the main point of contact for any audit the company has to go through

This is not everything to be considered, but it’s a good start. You’ve set yourself an ambitious goal, you’ll need to do a lot more research and find a way to stay up to date with this environment. A lot of articles come up almost daily explaining problems for specific versions or services, how to avoid or fix them, or what to change.@peachesmotorsports Thank you for the quick response.  Right now I’m pushing through the CSS course, I’ve completed “HTML” and “Learning the Command Prompt” I was thinking about doing the JAVA course and then moving into SQL all of this seems pretty basic and not that difficult, so I will definitely take your advice. My knowledge in coding is very minimal so I was advised to start from the basics and work my way up, I want to build a good foundation in knowledge and familiarity. In your opinion, am I taking unnecessary steps? and would you recommend the Backend Engineer stack course provided here? And to answer your question, I was looking at Amazon or Google mainly because of their size and the projected income for the desired position. Thank you again for taking to time to point me in the right direction.The size of Google or Amazon isn’t necessarily a strength, and neither is the salary. Getting a position there is not easy, there are many candidates. You can get the same or higher salary at other companies. Some of their perks might be of interest to you, but again those perks can be found elsewhere.
Basic CSS and HTML knowledge never hurt anybody, but I’d focus on Python rather than JAVA as it’s more useful for backend services. Skip the individual SQL course and just take the Backend Engineer course.
Front-end wise you don’t need to know how to code, but you do need to know how they work, how to deploy, and how things integrate which is why I mentioned nginx and REDIS (mostly because that’s what we use, there are other features out there that are useful). This is not covered by the courses but can be learned through youtube videos or blogs.
You also need to learn how to deploy code, whether it’s to the cloud or a data center, windows, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, etc. I haven’t taken the time to search for a resource that gives you ideas for projects so you can practice, I’ve thought about creating one since I have some projects that can be used for just that.AWS does have a program where they work with military veterans. Have you looked into this:
https://aws.amazon.com/careers/military/ 2
They have a technical apprenticeship for careers in cloud computing.@peachesmotorsports thats a good point, thank you. Ill just skip java for now and focus on Python, and the same for the SQL. now would it be more beneficial for me to take the python course before diving into the Backend Engineer course? Im definitely going to take your advice, thanks alot for all of this information!
@lisalisaj I actually didnt know that and I will have to look into it, thank you!"
66,Sooo…can we remove courses from our dashboards yet?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,6,235,"I’m really confused because I feel like this is an essential feature that should have been implemented into the dashboard from day 1.
Apparently, this request goes back to 2016 



Remove Course from Dashboard–Still Not Possible?


All I can find is stuff from 2016, saying that it’s not possible yet.


And @phoenixgirl898 is right. This is a post from 2016 where ryan, a Codecademy Advisor would say:

Unfortunately, it’s not possible to remove courses or paths from your dashboard at this time. While several users have requested this feature, we don’t have a timeline for it right now.
If you really want to clean up your dashboard, you can create a new account .

^ So this hasn’t been on the “timeline” for 4 years? Got it.
Here’s the general consensus I’ve observed from users and moderators…

People finish a course and don’t need to see it on their dashboard cluttered with other courses that they are currently taking:

[ok the quoting feature decided not to work anymore but…] cloudplayer12621 said:

yeah this is nuts. I signed up for codeacademy 2 years ago to learn SQL. I have now been using SQL everyday for 2 years and have no need to continue the courses. yet I cannot delete them.

the moderator followed up with this message and then locking the thread…
zainabr1Moderator Emeritus said:

Reset course feature has been added to courses main page

this feature does not solve the problem of removing a course from the dashboard, and simply resets the progress of a course. This feature would soon later cause some confusion with those trying to remove a course from the dashboard (TLDR below):

Some people accidentally join paths/courses This example is a bigger overarching problem with clarity on how paths connect to courses that some people may already be taking, but it still was caused by and made much much worse by the lack of a remove course from dashboard feature.

7 days ago:



Reset progress without knowing because there was no clear warning on what exactly would happed


At some point I went into “Analyze Data with Python” path for a quick look. It started the path, which is not what I wanted. I only wanted to see what it was without actually starting it. Because I didn’t want it showing as if I was working on it, I clicked the reset progress button and confirmed.
Later in the day I was at my home page and noticed that my progress of “Learn Python 3” was way lower than it should. At first I thought that maybe there was a bug or something wrong with the website. Only afterwards did I think that it might have had something to do with having clicked that reset button on that other course.
It’s a very bad way to connect different courses like that. The little sentence at the bottom of the reset window is clearly not enough. There should be a clear warning when something will actually be deleted, especially if it’s something not in the current page. It should say clearly exactly which courses will be affected, especially considering how big the consequences are.
Keep in mind that I hadn’t started the “Analyze Data with Python” path, so in my mind there wasn’t anything to delete. At that moment all I thought that would happen was that that particular path wouldn’t show as having been started, nothing more. The content should only be allowed to be deleted from the same course in which it was created.
This is very discouraging and actually makes me loose my motivation to continue here. I feel like I lost all my time, considering that I already knew the basic things in Python and only went trough all of those first lessons just for the sake of completeness. So it would really be a waste of time to go through them yet once more.


TLDR: This guy tried to remove a path from his dashboard that he accidentally joined, but instead reset the progress for a subsequent course in that path that he was actually taking. Oh, and it didn’t get removed from his dashboard of course.

Some people have taken outdated courses (i.e. Python 2 -> Python 3) and would like to remove it from their dashboard to reduce clutter:




How do I remove courses from my dashboard?


I’m trying out Python 2, but then they released Python 3 and I’d rather just have 1. Is it actually possible to remove the course?


the moderator would respond:



How do I remove courses from my dashboard?


If you desperately want a completely clean slate, the only option would be to create a brand new account with Codecademy. You would, however, lose all your progress from all courses because, well, it’d be a brand new account.


Really!? Create a new account in order to remove a course from a dashboard? How is that at all efficient? You can’t transfer progress to the new account, so there’s literally no point in doing that. Like the moderator says, this “fix” resets all progress from all courses, so I am very very confused about that response, plus the lack of any need to add the feature that without it creates such an inefficient workaround.
Can we please get a remove course/path from the dashboard feature?
If there is a problem with that, I think it would be helpful explaining briefly why this is such a complicated process to add such a feature to the team’s timeline.
Making a new account or telling people to use the reset progress button does not work, and shouldn’t be unanimous with the ‘remove from the dashboard’ feature anyway. And as we saw above with @slacle, this actually further confuses things.
Also, if someone wants to reset a path in general, either clarify and show the specific courses that they have in progress in that path that will be reset, or don’t reset those ‘in progress’ courses at all.
Ultimately, many people feel like this should have been added a long time ago, and telling us to make a new account and lose all of our progress instead of bringing some clarity as to why the request can’t be fulfilled is kind of weird tbh.Hello, @bazeroni
I don’t think you’ll find much, if any, disagreement from anyone here. Perhaps, @lilybird or @alyssavigil, when they have some time, could investigate, and fill us in on whether there are any plans to add the desired feature to the main CC site?I’m extremely disappointed that Codecademy does not have this feature implemented to allow us to remove courses from the ‘My Courses’ dashboard. This is among the most basic interface options students should have. I think I pay enough with Codecademy Pro that they can afford one of their programmers to add this in. I found a thread going back to 2016 requesting this same feature. any updates? @lilybird @alyssavigilhi @bazeroni, I’ve sent your request to our product team that works on the dashboard. let’s see what they say!Have they responded if so, what did they say?@lilybird What did they say?  Especially now when there are the new paths - frontend, backend and fullstack.
I would like to just delete the web dev path, since I just transitioned to the fullstack."

I am doing the front-end path. Is it advisable to complete the related courses while I do it? That is, while I study HTML, I should also do the individual HTML course and so on with all the technologies? Or is what is taught on the path the same?

I would personally get half way through the path, then maybe extend to other paths, depending if I’m struggling or not.Keep in mind, HTML is involved with a couple other languages. Here are the paths I would suggest to go with HTML:
CSS - If you plan on building websites, trying not to use HTML is like trying to bake a cake without an oven. I’m sure it is possible to heat the cake batter sufficiently, but I am pretty sure it will be time-consuming and not taste very good in the end. CSS is for styling your websites so they don’t look like a bland, white page.
JavaScript - HTML and CSS can only go so far in terms of interactivity. JavaScript allows you to make your page come to life. It is not required, but I would highly suggest it.
(OPTIONAL) SQL - SQL is basically a way to manage data, but honestly, I have not used it (and don’t really plan on). I do know it is a way of storing data, so it might be another thing you might want to use.Thank you very much for the advice! Probably I will complement the path with the courses themselves as I progress as you have indicated.
Sorry for my level of English!

68,Trying to understand C# code,Community,4,48,"Hey
I’m a C# beginner and I’m working on a new project of mine. However, I’m trying to go on with this project using tools that already exist in the market, one of them is Open Hardware Monitor 2. I want to understand what is happening in the code, but naturally, I am not getting that. Could someone explain me some basic things? Like what is the “?” thing when you declare a variable? (i.e: float? Voltages { get; }) And what is dollar symbol ? (i.e: _var = windows.“dollar symbol” ) Ps: I didn’t get to put thew symbol, that’s why I wrote “dollar symbol”When declaring a variable ? means that it is nullable.  Value types cannot be null unless explicitly allowed.  Reference types can be null so do not need ?.
Not sure about the $.  Do you have a link to a file and line number?OOH, got it now! Thank you!
About the $, it is JavaScript, I confused myself.
I want to take functions that takes the temperatures and voltages for me from this repo: OHM 1 but I’m not actually finding it. ;-;In whatever hardware you are looking for (say intel CPU) there should be an update method.  That seems to update the value of off the sensors.  I looked at Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU and the first thing it gets is the Temperature, I’m going to guess voltage is in there too.  You will still have to follow the method calls to find the actual place the temperature is retrieved but it seems the update method in the specific hardware class is the lowest level you can go before it starts being different for the different hardware types.Thank you, that surely cleared a bit all this darkness. I’ll try to track the methods and see what I get."
69,[Challenge] Sum of Prime Factors,Featured Challenges and Events,40,36.3k,"Code Challenge, April 5th 2017
Every two weeks, we feature the type of brain-teasing question that might be asked in a full-stack developer’s job interview.
For this week’s challenge:

Write a function that finds the sum of all prime factors 1.5k of a given number, n.

Try to write your function without using trial division 1.1k!
Scroll down and reply to this thread with your code to participate!

Extra Credit
Intermediate Difficulty
If you’d like to go a step further:

Write a function that finds the sum of each unique prime factor of a given number, n. For example, 3 is the only prime factor of 9.

Advanced Difficulty
For a final, more advanced challenge, your code should run in sub-linear time (find out what we mean by reading about Big O notation and complexity here 231 and here 87).  There’s also an old (and thus unsupported) Codecademy course on Big O here 106 (thanks @mindful_coder).

How to participate
We featured the best submissions entered in the opening few days of this challenge here, but do feel free to continue to post your answers below!
Happy coding!

The fine print:

Remember, the point of code challenges like these is to test and stretch yourself with an unusual problem, so don’t be dissuaded if you find it difficult or don’t know where to start!  Start with Googling, but see if you can find out how to think about the problem and what tools you need to solve it, but don’t just go looking for the solution itself.  This way, it’ll be a better learning exercise for you - developers can’t always find and copy “the right answer” online, which is why questions like these are used in developer job interviews!

Hi there!
here are my solutions for the sum of prime factors and the sum of unique prime factors:
def sum_of_prime_factors(n):
	divisor = 2 #starting with 2, as it is the smallest prime number
	sum = 0 #at the beginning we dont have anything added up, therefore 0
	while divisor <= n/2: # as 2 is the smallest possible divisor, we only need to check for numbers up to n/2. If this value is reached, we can skip and assume, that the rest of n will be our last prime factor.
		if(n%divisor == 0): #if our divisor divides n without rest, it is a prime factor of n.
			n = n/divisor #therefore we devide n by our divisor
			sum = sum + divisor # and sum it up
		else: #if is does not divide, we check the next higher number
			divisor = divisor + 1

	return sum+n #add up our last prime factor here
	# it is no problem here to check for numbers not being primes themselves, as we start with the smallest primes we will have splitted the number into something that cant contain any mulitples of those. 

#for uniques it is kind of the same code, except that we remember, with which number we last devided our input and act accordingly
def sum_of_unique_prime_factors(n):
	divisor = 2
	sum = 0
	lastDivisor = 0 # in this case, we also have to know, what our last divisor was, so we can skip it for sum-computation if it occurs multiple times
	while divisor <= n/2:
		if((n%divisor) == 0):
			n = n/divisor
			if(divisor != lastDivisor): # the check for non-unique divisors happens here, if it occured multiple times, it will not be summed up another time
				lastDivisor = divisor
				sum = sum + divisor
		else: 
			divisor = divisor + 1

	return sum if n == lastDivisor else sum+n #add up our last prime factor here, if it's another unique one

for optimization it would be great to have a precomputed list of primes, instead of iterating through all numbers including the multiples of primes

This is my attempt: it leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes method. No arithmetic divisions!! The method of the SoE is easily available elsewhere.
I agree it’s a really inefficient use of memory: I also have a class that implements a long array of booleans in an array of integers, but it’s a bit long for just the simple answer here. Let me know if you want to see that too!!
#! /usr/bin/python3

# get the value to be looked for from the command line
# no type checking here!
import sys
TARGET=int(sys.argv[1])

# set up an array of booleans up to and including the TARGET
sieve = [False] * ( TARGET + 1 )

# in classic Erathosthenes, cross out all the non primes
# note: if the sieve lands on the TARGET, then it's a factor
# so remember it.
primes = []
number = 2

# we have to go all the way up to the target in case
# it's a prime itself!
while number <= TARGET:

    for n in range(number, TARGET+1, number): 
        # mark all the multiples of number because they're
        # obviously not prime
        sieve[n] = True
        # if it matches the TARGET, then it's a factor
        if n == TARGET: primes.append(number)

    # move on to the next prime number
    while (number <= TARGET) and (sieve[number]) == True:
        number += 1

# Here is the answer
print(primes)
print(sum(primes))


Tim FThis is my code. It’s written in C++. It has 3 functions and the main().
The prime factors are stored in an array of integers which were checked befor if they are prime.
Then another recursive function calculates the sum of the array and it is printed to the console.
// Write a function that finds the sum of all
// prime factors of a given number, n.
//

#include ""stdafx.h""
using namespace std;
int arr[1000000];

// function checks if the number is prime
int isPrime(int b)
{
	for (int i = 1; i * i <= b; i++)
	{
		if (b % i == 0 && i != 1) return 0;
	}

	return 1;
}

// calculates the sum of the array with factors
int sum(int arrl)
{

	if (arrl == 0) return 0;
	else return sum(arrl - 1) + arr[arrl - 1];
}

// identifies prime factors and stores them into an array
int primeFactors(int n, int arrl)
{
	for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
	{
		if (n % i == 0 && isPrime(i))
		{
			arr[arrl++] = i;
		}
	}


	return sum(arrl);
}




int main()
{
	int arrl = 0, n, sum1;

	// input
	cin >> n;

	// Functions are called
	sum1 = primeFactors(n, arrl);
	cout << sum1 << endl;
	system(""pause"");
    return 0;
}



here’s another way to do it:
(This time it prints the sum of all prime factors even if the are repetited)
#include ""stdafx.h""
using namespace std;

// function which calcuates the sum of the prime factors
// a variable 'add' which stores the sum
// and 'n' the input number
int factorSum(int add, int n)
{
	for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
	{
		while (n % i == 0)
		{
			// divide and add the value to 'add'
			n /= i;
			add += i;
		}
	}

	// return the sum
	return add;
}


int main()
{
	int sum, add = 0, n;

	cin >> n;
	sum = factorSum(add, n);
	cout << sum << endl;

	system(""pause"");
    return 0;
}



I’ve also designed a version of it in PYTHON.
I’m surprised that it’s much shorter.
# n the number, sum must be 0 so we can add factors to it
def factors_sum(n, sum = 0):
    # every number smaller than n+1 (if n is prime) 
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # check if it can be divide by i
        while n % i == 0:
            # divide
            n /= i
            # add to sum
            sum += i
    # return their sum
    return sum
Here is my attempt in Python, sum of factors and of unique factors.
Could not quite avoid the trial division though )-;
import math

def is_prime(n):
	for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+1):
   		if n % i == 0:
   			return False  #composite
	return True #prime


def prime_factors(p):
	result = []
	
	if p == 1:
		result.append(1) #avoid looping forever
		return result

	while p%2 == 0: #not included in range step
		result.append(2)
		p = p/2

	for i in range(3, p+1, 2): #no need to test even numbers
		if is_prime(i):
			while p%i == 0:
				result.append(i)
				p = p/i
		if p == 1: #no more factors to find
			break
	
	if len(result) == 0: #p is prime
		result.append(p)
	
	return result

def sum_of_factors(p):
	return sum(prime_factors(p))

def sum_of_unique_factors(p): 
	return sum(list(set(prime_factors(p))))
Rereading the problem and looking at other submissions, there is a way of listing all the prime factors, not just unique ones. Here is revised code:
#! /usr/bin/python3

# get the value to be looked for from the command line
# no type checking here!
import sys
TARGET=int(sys.argv[1])

# set up an array of booleans up to and including the TARGET
sieve = [False] * ( TARGET + 1 )

# in classic Erathosthenes, cross out all the non primes
# note: if the sieve lands on the TARGET, then it's a factor
# so remember it.
primes = []
number = 2
# need a sacrificial copy of the target in order to do sequential divisions
whatsLeft = TARGET

# we have to go all the way up to the target in case
# it's a prime itself!
while number <= TARGET:

    for n in range(number, TARGET+1, number): 
        # mark all the multiples of number because they're
        # obviously not prime
        sieve[n] = True
        # if it matches the TARGET, then it's a factor
        if n == TARGET:
            # add an element to the primes for each time
            # number divides into the target
            while whatsLeft % number == 0:
                primes.append(number)
                whatsLeft = whatsLeft / number
            # we can short circuit the rest if we've found all the factors
            if whatsLeft == 1: 
                number = TARGET+1
                break

    # move on to the next prime number
    while (number <= TARGET) and (sieve[number]) == True:
        number += 1

# Here is the answer
print(primes)
print(sum(set(primes)))


This is my first attempt at a discuss challenge, sorry for having to have more than one go!
Tim FHere’s my take on the challenge 
Please feel free to tell me ways to optimise my code/more efficient ways of getting the same result
#sum of n's unique prime factors

n = input(""Choose a positive integer greater than 1:"")#user input of a single positive integer

divisor = 2 #starting the divisor variable at 2 because that's the lowest prime factor possible
prime_factors = [] #list of all the prime factors of n
pf_sum = 0 #initializing the sum of n's prime factors at 0

if b == 1:
    print()
    print('The number 1 is called a unit. It has no prime factors and is neither prime nor composite.') #output in case user inputs 1
else:
    while b > 1: #loop to be repeated while b is higher than 1
        if b % divisor == 0: 
            prime_factors.append(divisor) #if b/divisor 's remainder is 0 then divisor will be added to the prime_factors list as a prime factor of n
            b = b / divisor #lower b to the value of b/divisor to make sure the prime factorization doesn't repeat itself
        else:
            divisor += 1 #in case the divisor wasn't a prime factor then we add 1 to the current divisor

'''print(prime_factors) #debugging'''

if int(n) != 1:

Here’s my attempt.  It’s a very “off the cuff” approach; I’m not familiar with any advanced mathematical concepts related to prime numbers… but I’ve been exposed to them now, thanks to this challenge!
I’ve outlined my thought process in my comments, to the best of my ability on a late night, at least!
Admittedly, my code is a bit bloated for the challenge. And there are probably some blocks that would be better-served as functions.  Nonetheless, it has worked with a good quantity of random test numbers.
I structured it as a loop, so that a user can repeatedly enter numbers, until ‘0’ is entered, without having to rerun the script.
I had to learn basic Python for this; it was a fun experience.  I’m happy to have any positive or constructive feedback.   
Thanks for looking!
Use it on repl.it 2
(I’m new to this system, and I couldn’t figure out how to embed the repl.it like the user above.  Adding the embed script did nothing.  A pro-tip on that would be great!)
# ***THOUGHTS***
# The approach used in this solution admittedly causes iterations with factors that are not prime.
# I should go back sometime and see if there is a performance gain or loss by checking whether a factor is prime before attempting the modulus operation.
#   My ""sniff test"" result is that it would (slightly) decrease performance in checking if the factor is a prime number, because multiple operations would be performed for each candidate factor before performing the modulus check.
#   As written, all potential odd factors are checked.  But they are only processed once if they are not a prime factor of the input number.
#
# There are some chunks of code that would be better served as functions... perhaps for v2!
#
# I'm sure there are some inconsistencies or deviations from Python conventions.  Please forgive them; this is my first attempt at Python.

So it’s pretty messy, but if it helps someone find a better way to do it, fine by me.
I used recursion and a prime tuple I got off this guy 4 to check for divisors and add those together. I think it should run pretty fast though the limitations are quite obvious. I also tried to be extra polite to all the functions.

Edited a big oversightOops! I realized that there are a couple of issues if I enter a number that results in floor(sqrt(number)) < 3. I’m working on updating to account for that now and will update the code above one it’s resolved.
EDIT/UPDATE
All better!
I realized that the special case was not 1.  The special cases are 1, 2, and 3, because these numbers are, themselves, prime.  And it is mathematically impossible for them to have a prime factor that is > 1.
I also added a function to display results, both to be a bit DRY-er and to slightly increase readability of the code.Here is my answer, it’s made of two functions, the first one receives a number and it returns a list with all the posible prime numbers. It only analizes odd numbers because even numbers can’t be primes. The second function receives a number num, it calls the primes function and for every prime number, if it’s a factor of num it will add it to value, which is the sum of all the prime numbers.
After I made this, i added a new parameter to the sum_primes function to allow calculate the sum of all of the unique primes.
def primes(number):
    primes_list = [2]
    max_num = number//2
    num = 3

I am so excited! Also, I was looking for suggestions on what to do next, I’ll definitely do a bunch of the Python skill paths, but after that, what should I do?Congratulations!! 
I’m biased…so, I suggest Data Science. 
(I mean, if that sort of thing interests you.)
What are you interested in doing with Python? Are you interested in learning other languages? What do you want to build to solve a problem?Nice work!!
It looks like there are a lot of cool Python courses, and you’ve already said you plan on taking a bunch of them. Maybe you can add a goal of completing a couple personal projects that you publish on Github using your new skills too. It may help you find what really interests you.
Although I haven’t taken it myself yet, I’d have to agree with @lisalisa’s suggestion. That Data Science career path is looking goodGood job, that is really good, good luck with your next courses! congratulations! I completed my Python3 Course last week. I am feeling lost after having completed the course. If you have any pointers, it would be awesome if you could compare notes."
73,"Codecademy Pro, Student Discount",Community,20,65.1k,"Dear Community and Codecademy,
My name is Will, and I am a middle school student currently enrolled at Postlewait Middle and Ceasar Rodney High School in Delaware. As a member of the Technology Student Association, I would like to learn how to code in depth. Although I have looked a other free options to learn, I originally started with Codecademy when it was still 100% free and became accustomed and somewhat attached to the way Codecademy teaches. However, although my family is not financially challenged, I don’t feel that I can pay $20.00 a month for Codecademy. I am not suggesting that learning to code with this amazing program is not worth it and should be free, although that would be nice, but I do think that there should be a discount. I was hoping that a Codecademy employee would read this and possibly be able to add a student discount to bring the price down, for students, to (in my mind) around $5.00 a month.
Thank you for you attention,
Will
An aspiring coder.Hello,
Codecademy doesn’t give out discounts, however all the lessons are FREE to access, only the following is pro:

http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=third-degree+price+discrimination 1.6k
You should seriously be applying third degree price discrimination to your pricing model so kids like Will here can get you more profit, and Will can consume a product/service which can’t cost you more on a marginal basis of 1 more paid user.A lot has changed in your pricing since last year.  There are less unpaid options today than in the past.  Again, it’s all good to charge but maybe an educational group price per school might be in order.Agree with @jhauer. There are many high school students who want to learn coding and it would be really nice to have any kind of discount for us. Even-though cost of your site is not that elevated comparing to others, high school students usually can’t work and any extra way of saving is always nice.With the increase of content being hidden behind a paywall, a student discount sounds like a fantastic idea. I know some University students that could use the help. Codecademy seems to become less and less an Academy and more and more a Commercial business not aiming at students at all. Luckely there are alternatives like repl.it or SoloLearn - Even a basic course on basics on Python 3 is on the PRO account now…I feel you, man. The Python 3 course being behind a paywall really triggers me. Most courses that CodeCademy has can be supplemented by an O’Reilly Media programming book bought off Amazon (depending on the book, somewhere between the price of 3-6 weeks of Pro) and a StackExchange (or something like it) account (free).
If a course will take more than 3-6 weeks to learn, and you want a physical reference, you are definitely better off buying a book.I love the way the do the courses, many times people just have an answer pop quiz but no hands on training, I think this is a good site to learn at but to expensive for people trying to learn something other than what  a bed feels like and can’t be able to go outside and enjoy life:( just maybe they can enjoy the programming life instead:) I am disabled and enjoy it here and hopefully one day I can get a job coding. This also helps with mental disorders, it scrambles your brain to forget and yes this does help alot with me, I have ptsd bad and I go straight to coding world and it sets my mind to a new way of life.
Love this site and it works!I definitely agree with you. I attend the University of Florida and am offered educational pricing for products like Word, Adobe, and Lynda (LinkedIn). It would be great to include Codecademy on the list.
Just like Will, I would also like to access the Pro resources, but am unable to afford it at the current rates.
I hope the team at Codecademy will consider expanding their reach to encompass university students who want access to such great resources.I too wish that Codecademy would offer a student discount. I was using Codecademy for Python 3 but now have to stop. I now have stopped using Codecademy altogether as there are free options to learn Python 3 elsewhere. A student discount would greatly increase profits and accessibility of Codecademy and would help more people use it for more than just coding basics.
I hope Codecademy will consider this option down the line. I love the tutorials and lessons you offerWhatever the CA powers that be decide on Student Pricing (a good idea, to my mind), it’s positively a slap in the face to be offering Python 2 as the “free” Python offering.

Let’s not play games with semantics. The way I see the situation for 2.7 is
that EOL is January 1st, 2020, and there will be no updates, not even
source-only security patches, after that date.
… Guido van Rossum 28
Perhaps CodeAcademy should offer K-12 pricing to institutions to distribute access to their students such as Will. Certainly a middle school student whop wants to learn to code should be encouraged, and it is plausible that such students may have no disposable funds .      College students are a different story. A college student can either use the resources of their college, learn to code from one of the many free tutorials on line, or come up with the $20 a month for code academy.Seems no one cares about this anymore, I should say that for most of the people living in the 3rd world (like me ) 15$/mo is a little bit expensive, I know that it takes a lot of time and effort to make this great platform work and i appreciate it a lot but having a student discount will be wonderful.Thank you, i appreciate it.Is there an update on this? I also would like to know student pricing.Hey Darby,
I think the same too. I’m now also a university student. Yes, there has many sites and products who have offered some discount or free pricing, excluding Codecademy and also some others. It would be great if they consider that thing for students.
But now Codecademy is giving access to pro accounts all over the world for everyone who has .edu and .k12 mail, they can have access to the pro account for 90 days due to COVID-19. Go and grab it now I would sign up to a Pro account in a heartbeat if there was a student discount. Finished my free trial and really enjoyed it, especially the projects, but the current subscription prices/models don’t really fit my student budget.
$39.99 each month is a little steep. The $19.99 per month for the annual is reasonable, but I can’t really afford the entire year up front. Not sure how things work in other countries, but in my country we receive our student loans in three instalments throughout the year. I could afford to pay $19.99 each month, or $60 a term, but $200+ from one of my loan instalments is a little too much.
Would love a wider variety of subscription plans.It doesn’t work. I’m in college so I don’t know if the discount would apply to me. It never asked for verification and wouldn’t let me complete the transaction anyway, so I ended up paying the full price.As far as I understand, there is no discount."

76,Day 50/100 and counting,30-Day Challenge,21,284,"My personal goal was 30days in a row.
When I achieved that, I wanted more.
So I set up the goal to 50 and I’m now pursuing 100.
Set small achievable goals and you’ll genuinely ask yourself for more.
-What’s your personal goal and how far have you gone?
-Share your thoughts and good luck on your journey. 
Congratulations on sticking at it! Takes motivation to keep going everyday but the rewards make it worth it.
I have set myself the 30 day challenge at the minute and am on day 4 of my Full Stack course at the minute (started from scratch to get back into coding due to pandemic). Getting involved with the community on the codecademy discord is a sure boost to my motivation and also coming to the forums everyday keeps me interested.
Also I joined a lovely group to do with coding and the guys in there make it a fun enviroment to learn and enjoy myself at the same time. I believe community is one of the most important things when it comes to staying motivated.Hi!
Your streak of 50 days in a row is awesome, many things can happen to break that streak (a simple flu?).
What I am curious about is after that journey, what’s your most valued experience? I mean, lessons learned for the noobs of us!
Jorge.Hey Jorge,
My goal is 100 days now, so I haven’t finished yet.
However, if you commit to start the journey just stick to the plan.
When you’re losing motivation, just visualize the reason why you started and where you want to go.
CheersI like thinking of coding like brushing your teeth: a little every day goes a long way. Take advantage of days when you are extra motivated and crush it, and make sure that on days you don’t feel like it you still get at least 10 minutes in. It will keep your memory fresh and engaged with the content My first personal goal is to finish the Javascript course. More will follow.Yeah, set small achievable goals.I believe I can do it. And your goal?Ofc you can do it! 
My personal goal is to hit 100 days streak and finish my full-stack engineer path.I wish you a lot of success on your journey.
Are you doing well?I can say that I’m doing quite well.
I have finished HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git/Github and I will start React.js.
I’m pretty pleased so far with both my progress and with Codecademy’s path.Wow, my current streak is only 6 days, good luck on getting 100 days. What I do is I set a reminder on my phone every day for around noon, to remind me to code.It will become second nature for you, to code daily.
It just takes some time.
Best wishes!721564×649 68.4 KB
P.S. Bring days streak baaaack!!! :""(I have to say that I agree on this one. I liked seeing the total number of days in the upper right corner. I already make it (coding) part of my day, so, I don’t need to see a weekly target b/c I’ve already set it for myself.
If there was a toggle switch and the learner could choose which one they saw on their dashboards, that’d be cool.Hey @konstantinosr23,
First of all, a huge shout out to you for your dedication to learning! Amazing to see this incredible streak 
I’m a product manager at Codecademy, and we recently launched the weekly targets feature that you see there. The main reason we launched this, is that we believe it will help our learners build more consistent learning habits, by allowing you to set your own commitment.
We have introduced the “weekly streak”, which I see that you already have 9 weeks in a row of meeting your targets! We believe that having streaks on a weekly basis vs. daily is more sustainable for our learners. Meanwhile, you can still find your daily streak in your profile section.
Best of luck on your 100-day coding journey, and free feel to message me if you have any questions!
Richiethanks for the feedback @lisalisaj, we’ll definitely consider this Hey @richiewu,
Thanks for reaching out.
My point of view is that a weekly target for practice is more maintainable and sustainable for the learners.
On the other hand, a daily streak can easily be broken and discourage someone.
So, in my opinion, you’ve just implemented a great feature, a well-needed feature.
However, as @lisalisaj said, a toggle option would be a blessing.
Thanks again, Richie!30 days challenge done 
Currently on day 73/100.

It appears to happen with a specific question. When I run on desktop I am able to answer some questions but eventually the error page appears when I try to move to the next question. For the Node.js quiz I was able to answer almost all the questions. Once I was able to open the quiz in mobile, I noticed 1 question that I had not previously seen while on desktop. All the other questions were the same and I was able to complete the quiz.
On some quizzes the issue appears to be connected to multiple questions.
Because questions are randomized, it may or may not happen upon starting the quiz.

79,Is anyone else getting error messages for no reason?,Support,14,47,"Is anyone else getting error messages for no reason?
To complete the first task of extending the HospitaEployee class with an empty class called ‘Nurse’, I put this:
class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
}
but js.lint is telling me there’s an unexpected indentifier:
/home/ccuser/workspace/learn-javascript-classes-classes-inheritance-iii/main.js:7
class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
^^^^^
This has happened to me before, where even copying from the example and pasting into the console produces an error. I tried with a different browser, but got the same result.
Anyone know why, please?If you have an error at the start of a line, checking the line(s) above.
for example when you forgot to close a bracket (can either be: ) or }), so difficult to say without seeing the full codeEvery time this error has occured, it was when I hadn’t toucheed the code that was already present in main.js, I just added a line of valid code. A couple of times, even asking for the solution didn’t fix it; codecamy’s bot completed the assignment by filling main.js with the correct code, but js.lint would still parse it as invalid and throw an error.
Here’s the contents ofmain.js:
class HospitalEmployee {

  constructor(name) {

    this._name = name;

    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;

  }

 

 class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {

  }

  get name() {

    return this._name;

  }

  

  get remainingVacationDays() {

    return this._remainingVacationDays;

  }

  

  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {

    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;

  }

}
You nested your child class within your parent class/in the body of your parent class, why?Because it says to do exactly that:
“Under HospitalEmployee , create an empty class named Nurse that extends HospitalEmployee .”in this case under means after. Or the lines under closing the HospitalEmployee class
In programming, analytic and critical thinking is far more important then the code. When you instructions, you should ask yourself: what i am trying to do, and why?I appreciate the advice, thank you, but I (and probably many  other cc users) have a nuerological disorder that causes me to take written instructions very literally (much like a computer!).
In previous assignments, the wording of the instructions specifically said: “At the bottom of main.js add a line that says…”.
Also, the term ‘under’ has meant, in other assignments, to write the line of code under the one indicated.
In the absence of other visual cues, a person like me will refer back to previous word uses in an attempt to clarify the intent, which is analytic and critical thinking. Once again, context is everything.
Your advice is completey correct, and it would be excellent for a nuerotypical student, but people with ADHD or autism (like me), have difficulties with mental problems. When we get stuck, it’s harder to step back and see the problem, we just get locked in to the fact that we are doing what we were told to do and it isn’t working.
Codecademy is an excellent application, but I think that a little more consistency in the wording of the instuctions would save people like me a lot of frustration.
Thank you again.I get your point, but I don’t think I agree on all of them
People with autism seem very capable of programming. I don’t know if there are stats on this (I hope there are), but I think IT has a relative high percentage of autistic people. Like you said, this applies very possible to more people here on CC.
programming is primarily problem solving, something everyone needs to learn when they are learning to program. Of course, my answer was intended that you instantly become a master problem solver. But its something I wanted to make you aware of.
There is still a lot to learn about autism, but with new theories and models ( like Socioscheme[1] ), which enforces that autistic people might actually be really good problem solvers and analytic thinkers.
and that is what you should take away from this exercise (more then anything): Think about what you are doing and why. Be analytic, use that as your strength
where you need to go in the end is this: a client wants an app, which have certain requirements and features. Then there are no instructions at all.
of course, this is not the level you need for your first junior/entry level job. Then you are guided a bit more, and you start with small bug fix or a small feature.
[1] Unravelling Autism: Introduction to Autism with the Socioscheme F Delfos MartineI wasn’t suggesting that your advice was in any way flawed, or not applicable to people like me. Like I said; the advice was correct, full stop. I aslo was not suggesting that people wth ASD don’t make good programmers, on the contrary. It is specifically because of the disorder that ASD sufferers are great at problem solving (and yes, there is a high prevalence of nuerological disorders in the IT community, and stats are starting to emerge), and here is where the computer analogy applies again, because analytical thinking requires following logical structures; classifying items into specific, corroborable sections and identifying similarities between them, which means rules, just like the instructions of an algorithm. Problem solving is just breaking the problem down into its constituent parts, and then solving each small problem in order of complexity. The difficulty with thinking very logically though, is that like a computer, an ambigous or inconsistent instruction can send the problem solver in to a loop, or even a crash (like personal meltdowns).
A person can learn to cope with a neurological disorder, but it doesn’t go away with practice, as you seem to be sugesting.
Also, the requirements provided by a client for an app are not analogous to the logical obstacles encountered in writing the code for one. I work best with no instructions at all, just a set of requirements. It is when a neurotypical person provides precise instructions that I have trouble, because they think that what they are saying can only have one possible  inerpretation, and that the interpretation will be obvious to all, but being very logical, I follow instructions exactly as they are written, and this way of thinking is a product of the relationship between the different parts of the brain being different to that a neurotypical person (hence the term ‘neurological disorder’), and it is not something that is as simply resolved as just looking at the problem more objectively.
I still appreciate your help, but the solution to ensuring that a learning platform is as equally accesible to those with a learning difficulty as it to those without is to design it with that goal in mind (like using consistent wording), and not just expecting the user with the learning difficulty to learn to think like other people, because if it were that easy then being intelligent people, we would have learned to do that long ago.


 loneley:

but it doesn’t go away with practice, as you seem to be sugesting.


i do absolutely not suggest such a thing. I was merely saying all human beings need practice in problem solving skill if they want to become decent/good developer. Programming is problem solving and analytical foremost. Something everyone can get better at with practice.



 loneley:

but the solution to ensuring that a learning platform is as equally accesible to those with a learning difficulty as it to those without is to design it with that goal in mind (like using consistent wording),


no way this can ever be achieved.
And its missing the point completely I gave in my advice. This is the last I will say about it


 stetim94:

no way this can ever be achieved.


Why not? You MUST use consistent wording when talking to a <i.machine, or you get a syntax error. Why is it unrealistic to expect the person writing the instructions to the learner to apply the same level of attention to what they are telling to a person as to what they are telling to a computer? One would just have to remember to use the same words for the same instruction each time.Precisely for the reason you mention. Talking to a machine (a piece of rock) is not the same as talking to a human being. A programming language only understands a limited set of things, while a natural language like English is a lot more complex.
Furthermore, humans wrote those courses, very likely different people. Or content got updated by someone else then the original creator. You can’t expect all the humans to express themselves in exactly the same way. And to pour over everything everybody else wrote is simple you something don’t have time for (deadlines, cost). All the courses offered by codecademy also needs validation. People get promoted, fired, quit and so forth.
so now we have determined humans and organizations aren’t perfect (they can’t be), could we put the focus on that its a better idea to start thinking for one-self?
When instructions are presented, to think about: Why do I do this? And why? what does this matter for program? Where should this code be placed? And so forth.
Asking yourself these kind of questions will result in less frustration and much better coping. And it will make you a better programmer/developer.The page gave me a specific instruction to do something that would cause an error, because the person who wrote it didn’t take enough time to consider how that sentence could be interpreted.Noone needs to read everything that was already written, they just need to think about what they’re writing. We are here to learn to code, not learn alternative interpretations of English literature, or lessons of life’s inconsistent nature.  We are not discussing a logic problem, or a problem I had with javascript. The problem is with the ambiguous wording of the instruction, which is the responsobiity of the site, not the student."
80,Helpful Resource for Learning Command Line + Much More,30-Day Challenge,5,231,"Hey guys, I wanted to share a resource I came across that drastically accelerated my learning when I was on the command line portion of the Computer Science path here on Codecademy.
If you are like me, you probably got a bit confused when it came time to learn command line. The course offered on Codecademy seems to assume that you have some pre-existing knowledge of the syntax and, in my humble opinion, is not as beginner friendly as you would hope.
In my search for a more comprehensive tutorial on command line, I came across Ryan’s Tutorials 24 which has an absolutely amazing beginners guide to command line/linux as well as a number of other helpful beginner tutorials (number systems, bash scripting, boolean algebra, etc…).
I hope this helps someone! I went from having no understanding of command line to running Ubuntu and nearly exclusively doing everything from the command line in about a week.'A bit confused’doesn’t even begin to cover it, so I’ll be sure to check this out! Thanks!Let me know if it helps!The regular expressions seem to have good explanation  . Wish he included command line for windows . Thanks!Once you’re confident about linux command line then Windows is easy-peasy.
I would like to add another resource which is pretty good.

82,What was your win this week?,Random,6,87,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not!

Did you review someone else’s code & provide constructive feedback?
Did you finish a module?
Did you set a goal for something unrelated to code & meet that goal?

Excited to read about everyone’s win!  It was a slow week. Even though the time seemed to have flown by. Weird.
Code-related: I finished the lesson on the DS path for Classes. I definitely have a better understanding of code errors now and OOP. But, I’m still going to go back over it to fully cement it in my brain. I have a 167 day coding streak. Woo. 
Non-code: I finished crocheting two scarves–one being a gift for my friend for x-mas. Then I started another one. Yay! 


 lisalisaj:

It was a slow week. Even though the time seemed to have flown by. Weird.


For me it was such a fast week, which is a relief after the super slow week I had last week lol.
Coding Related: I have a 3 week coding streak, weekly coding streaks truly made everything easier for me (since I don’t usually code on weekends) 
I also made tons of progress with a personal project…I’ve been learning to be consistent and be honest with myself about how much effort I’m actually putting into it.
Non-coding related: I had TONS of non-coding related wins this week.
First off…
I watched Avengers Endgame.
(that was last weekend, not this week but anyways)
My feelings were all over the place, I cried a lot…and got so many chills during the portals scene   
I also FINALLY got the book of  The Art of Into the Spiderverse. I still can’t believe I have it in my hands. It’s just…INSANE  
I also drew what I consider to be my best digital drawing until now, and got to see some of my family members I hadn’t seen in a while Coding Related: Completed the extra features I had been working on for a project from the Learn A-Frame (VR) course. The features required the creation of components written in JavaScript using their ECS system. There were some technical hurdles to overcome with the latest version, so it took a fair amount of research and experimentation to get it just how I wanted.
Non-coding Related: Revamped the throwaway Twitter account I was forced to make 2 years ago to use another site into an account I can actually use if I want. No more random username, blank profile, etc.  I used it to tweet about the project I mentioned above.  Not sure if I’ll use it for anything else yet.
Semi-coding related: Figured out a workaround for a long-standing annoyance I had with the Codecademy Couse Catalog.  I had previously completed a career path and some skill paths that included a number of other courses, but because I completed them from within the paths, they always appeared as though I didn’t take them until I clicked to get more details.  There were a total of 14 courses that always didn’t show they were completed until I drilled down. This made hunting for more cool courses to take really annoying.I have worked for more than 40 hours this week on coding. I started creating a schedule for myself everyday and it has evolved to a stage now that just fits my workflow perfectly or rather my workflow fits the schedule perfectly. I asked a lot of questions this week to find answers and I found them with the help of many people from forums and I’m thankful for that as well.
Apart from that, I cleared a major gaming portion of Sekiro: Shadows die Twice in one seating which I never thought I’d be able to get in this playthrough. To be precise, I defeated Gyoubu, burning Bull and the ashina castle gate general all in one go. xD
Bonus: I hosted my first focus session this week of which I’m suuuuuuuuper proud of!Coding related: I finished the Web Scraping portion of the Data Science Path and am getting more confident using Pandas.
Non-coding related: I got new clothes and decorated the upstairs of my house for Christmas."

I’m a translator and interpretation(Turkish-French-English) student in a Turkish University whose name is Bilkent University. It is a actually quite popular and successful university and this is my third year in this department. I am happy with my department, but the main problem is that I met the computer at a very young age and I was interested in coding at a very young age, but I had never gone this far in coding. However, although I am satisfied with my department, when I started codeacademy this year, I realized that I enjoy coding and software lessons, more than i enjoy translating  and I would like to be a software engineer in the future. It is too late to change my department, unfortunately, I do not have such an opportunity, but I believe that I can improve myself in software engineering and coding with online lessons and my ambition. I am currently taking both translating and codeacademy together, and although it is tiring, it is very productive, especially my coding lessons. I know that a certain level of math is required for coding, and I know that my math was pretty good even if it is rusted, and I am ready to take lessons to remember math again. But my main concern is whether I will be able to find a software related job in the future even though I have not graduated from any software related department? Because, as you know, I won’t have any degree in software. What do you think about this? Your opinions are very important to me.

its possible, but not as simple as some people seem to think.
there is a good change you will have to do an internship first before they hire you as developer/software engineer/whatever you like to call itWhat would you suggest me to get on the same level with others?Practice, practice and more practice
build projects, try to get some of your projects. Study other peoples code on github can be helpful. Work with others if possibleThank you so much for your answers.

3457857cf60494b1df38c17a792433acef2f5c33.png1180×512

Hi everyone i am new to CSS. I have a WordPress template that i am trying to change some basic CSS on and also remove the inline css to the theme css folder. Its easy to put the code into the theme. I have located the css that gives all the images on my site a border which is perfect. The issue i have is when using firebug i noticed it was bootstrap css.
Any advise gratefully received
Thanks
DannyDoes it need to be responsive? If not javascript is great for doing math, get the width of the window, then divy that up among the number of images, their left & right margins, and the page padding between your images and the border.Hi the theme is responsive. As i mentioned i have located the CSS to give the images a border 
codeacadmeny.jpg856×613 40 KB

I just not sure what i need to copy into the theme css.
Thanks
DannyRecommend leave the theme.css alone (as it came out of the box). Write your own custom style sheet to override the built-in ones. You’ll thank yourself later.
e4e3d5932833a48c8f991ee18aab008ebca0368f.png2539×1102

I can do all the changes i need from within the theme. Its just identify what the element is. The widget is called #black-studio-tinymce-9. I tried to use #black-studio-tinymce-9 img {border: 2px solid; } in the css and no joy. Its all so confusing and everyone i speak to has a different opinion on what to do.
Thanks
DannyThe advantage of using your own unique custom style sheet is that you can revert to the default theme in one motion without changing any code except the page template. You can even store the CSS away from the theme so it’s never damaged or overwritten by an update.
/site_root/ ->
    css/ ->
        black-studio-custom.css

Find the template php that draws the head element and insert a link (after all the other CSS links). Your CSS must load last to have the greatest precedence."

Haven’t tried books yet. Any suggestions?It depends, what languages you are learning?Really Python and SQL (for Data Science).I use a lot of ones for python by Eric Matthes.I usually turn to official documentation when I know what I need but don’t know the specifics or the implementation. In cases where I have no idea how to accomplish something, StackOverflow and Google are great resources.I use official documentation like MDN, my favourite goto YouTube channels re net ninja and traversy channels.
I also use google and w3 schools a lot.I really want to ask how can someone get a mentor or guide in this  web dev journey because it can be overwhelming  and tough at times.
Sometimes I feel like I am in an ocean of knowledge and finding difficult to put all the parts together.I feel you, but what I do is take is one day at a time, don’t worry about the next lesson, and focus on the one you are on, and if you ever too overwhelmed, just take a break for the day and come back tommarow.Thank you for the response.

Inspired by:
What are your biggest struggles while learning to code? 1
Within this post, there are great points of wisdom.  Some of them are take notes, ask questions, engage on forums and work on projects.
Feel free to comment below.What is challenging to me is being able to figure out the mechanics for solutions and different methods. I feel like I can understand what you are trying to solve, but I get lost in the how. And the “how” is what teaches me more things (that I can apply to my own code).
When I was working on Censor Dispenser, there were solutions that utilized the python module re, which lost me completely (since I used indexing and string methods). I searched up the re module in hopes to understand the mechanics behind the solutions, but I wasn’t able to understand how it worked.
In a way I guess, I’m struggling with my problem solving and comprehension skills when it comes to coding.
It’s like, I try to understand a solution but can’t because I’m not sure HOW to understand it. I don’t understand how each part is working together to give you a solution. I don’t even understand the parts!
I especially dislike when I’m searching up the answer to a problem I have, and I find it in a old StackOverflow post only to find the solution is written in hieroglyphics. Because I can’t understand how the solution works, I can’t properly integrate it into my code.
I love to learn, so when confronted with all these many solutions that I could learn from but can’t, it’s challenging for me. It makes me feel like I’m not progressing. Like I’m stuck at this mediocre level of knowledge that shows in my code.I voted 50/50 for “staying motivated” and “other”, because the latter is the cause of the former.
I don’t have an issue getting stuck in and learning what I need to do what I want, but without a defined end goal I’m less inclined to do something. If I’ve got an idea for a hobby project or something I want to try and build, great - but as soon as I’m out of ideas, my inclination to write code is much less…I didn’t know I could select more than one option above. (doh!)
For me, it’s remembering everything and then getting frustrated when I don’t and the solution to my error/issue is something that I temporarily forgot. (if that makes sense?).
Sometimes I feel like I just can’t absorb what I’m learning and I have to go over it a few times (which is fine b/c that’s how I learn… but still). Right now, classes (which is a newer part of the DS path) has me a bit stuck. I get it in a general sense, but, completing the work…well, that’s slow-going. My cat is tired of hearing me talk things out, out loud. Hahaha.Being consistent is really hard for me. I could be learning about databases one day and the next one, decide that I’d like to learn to make games instead. And learning tiny bits of many things isn’t very useful tbh.
Even when I am sticking to one single topic to learn, it’s hard for me to decide to sit down, put my all into it for a few hours, and then do the same thing the next day.
Also my confidence has been decreasing lately, and I start comparing myself to other coders. Feeling like you don’t know the things you should/are expected to know, or that you are behind…that gave me a motivation boost at first, but now I think it’s just slowing down my learning (how ironic).I find remembering everything and getting frustrated the most difficult.
As I am not a professional coder or software developer yet, I am trying to learn all different kinds of code so I have a strong base to build upon. I get really frustrated when one language kind of hijacks another and I start doing java things in python. Because of the number of things I am trying to process, I sometimes forget a part of a language that is less used. When I make some type of mistake, I get really frustrated.
I also struggle with getting the hang of things sometimes. Like, I don’t understand HOW to understand.
I don’t really see an end to learning and sometimes I feel that gets frustrating like I might work for a really long time but get nowhere.
Don’t get me wrong, I like coding. It’s just that sometimes it really gets you and makes you frustrated."
94,I’m new. Recommend what I should learn first,Corner Bar,5,182,"Hi. I’m a copywriter and I wanted to learn coding because I might want to build a website or I think it will be good for my career prospects. But I feel like I’m too dumb to learn coding Can anyone recommend what I should learn first?
ThanksIf you want to build a website, HTML (the structure of a webpage) and CSS (the styling and positioning) is where you should start.
The advantage of html & css is that are relatively easy to learn, and you will see quick progress. So that certainly helps I will start there then.thanks😀Also try to think about what kind of website you want to make and why. If this is a website for your business or something personal, it might be faster/easier to simply use the builder provided by website hosts like Squarespace or Wix. Their builders are easy to use, almost like working on a Word document!You might consider learning WordPress first and messing around with it, then circling back to learn HTML  and CSS, then JavaScript if you find you enjoy typing the stuff in.
Another possibility is to play around with Scratch 3, which will expose you to basic programming concepts before having to worry about learning a new language at the same time.For a more varied option that leaves your choices open I would dig in deep to a language like Python or C++. Once you know one language it is much easier to learn others. For websites I would recommend JavaScript and maybe Python after. I see you have gotten some good advice too "

If someone know, then please tell us.Hi Vishal,
Yep, there are tons of sites!
Many cities (worldwide I would assume) have open data portals where you can grab city (or state data in the case of the US) data in a .csv or a json file.
Ex: NYC Open Data
https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us 2
The U.S. Census also has a TON of data.
https://www.census.gov 1
I’ve downloaded  data from both. There’s lots of clean up involved with Census data, but I just do that in Excel or with something like Open Refine.
Anything you’re interested in–gov, art,  sports, etc. probably has online repositories for their data. Because I’m a baseball nerd, I’ve also gotten data from Baseball Reference dot com.  (They’re an example of a site that forbids scraping. They will ban your IP if you do scrape. All their data is available for copying/pasting as a csv file.)
Oh, and I recently realized that the NY Met Museum allows ppl to scrape data from their site. I want to do that soon.
If you know how to build a web scraper, you can grab data from websites that way too. BUT, read the site’s guidelines/rules about scraping data from their sites. Many don’t allow it and others have very stringent rules. Here are some guidelines.

102,I am preparing myself to become a skilful web developer,30-Day Challenge,3,301,"I’ ve been learning web development since January of 2020. I need to tell you that I do not have a computer science background. My academic knowledge comes from physiology. However, I decided to be a developer in order to add more value to my life. Plus, this skill allows me to bring my ideas into reality, which is too important for my future career.
When I compare my first day and the stage that I am now in, I’d like to say that I made good progress. Honestly, I am highly motivated to master this skill in order to boost my professional career. but as motivation factor is not enough to master this skill I need a more clear vision about my path and its learning barriers and so on. In fact, I am thinking to enter Bootcamp. I have some strategic plans for it, but I am confused about it.  Is it worth time and money to go to the Coding Bootcamp?
I would be highly grateful if you could advise me on how to obtain it.It really depends which bootcamp you are aiming for. Learning by yourself is quite nice too if you can keep your motivation. The best thing to do is to create project and build a portofolio.
Plus, this skill allows me to bring my ideas into reality, which is too important for my future career.

This is exactly why I decided to take up web development. I’v always had so many ideas, but no skills to build them. To me that probably is my biggest weakness, and I am going to improve on it.Hi,

I Know Some of These Words
Hi there, welcome to the forums.



 micromaster20319:

I feel like I’m not getting enough material to actually learn what I’m doing. It’s as though I learn something once then I move on to the next thing without reinforcement.


As with many circumstances where we are responsible for our own learning, it is up to us to put the time in to make sure we understand the material.
Much as a university student who only attends the lectures will likely do worse than one who also spends time studying the recommended textbooks or reading journals/research papers for example, we would not expect a learner who simply completes each exercise and then moves on to have the same grasp of the content as one who does the lesson and then takes the initiative to practice with what they’ve learned before moving on.
It’s a recurring theme here - you will get back what you put into learning the material, in terms of the time and effort you invest in educating yourself.



 micromaster20319:

I mean I can read some Java, but when I taught myself HTML and CSS then to Bootstrap… I could build a site. I liked Freecodecamp a lot, but it’s limited in variety of code. I guess just keep going to another language then learn more advanced topics of Java independently and figure out how to apply it.


HTML and CSS have one clear, well defined application that is obvious - you use them to make web sites. In some ways, this limits them but it makes it much easier to say “this is what I’m learning this for”. You wouldn’t learn HTML if you wanted to understand the Linux kernel, for example.
Java - like every other programming language - is much less prescriptive in what you can do with it, because for any given programming language you can apply it to many different use cases. It may not be ideally suited to everything, but to an extent they are a case of “if you can imagine it, you can make it.”
The Pro career and skill paths are there to address this, to some extent. Taking Java as an example, there is a course on building Android apps using Java. We’re all pretty much glued to our phones these days, and who wouldn’t want to be in the position of potentially having their code running on 2.5 billion devices across the world?
The paths go beyond simply showing you the language, but also giving you an example area where you can apply that language.

106,What was your win this week?,Random,22,311,"What was your win this week? (It can be code related or not!)

Did you set out some time every day & start coding?
Did you teach someone else something that they were having trouble understanding?
Did you learn something new from attending an online webinar?

Excited to hear/read about everyone’s wins this week! I have a 27 day coding streak! This is the longest I’ve done so far. I plan to keep going too. Computer related: I got an upgrade on my GPU, the performance is much better compared to what I used to have! Though still not great compared to the super high end ones.
Non-computer related: Our firework show this year for the 4th was great!This weekend I get to see a very good friend that I haven’t seen in 3 years. And we’ve got some pretty cool stuff for the weekend!
A loss for the week: I tried making banana bread, and the Botton half of it came out weird. Not flaky and spongy, but dense. I wonder what it was? Flavor-wise it was pretty go though Ooo, bannana bread 
Sounds perfect to me, because I can never make up my mind on if I prefer spongy or dense Banana bread! Perhaps too much liquid and not enough baking time? Did you use oil or melted butter? Any milk in it?
Do you have a thermometer for your oven b/c many are off by at least 50 degrees.
I had made some browned butter banana walnut bread back in April and froze it. Took it out of the freezer and it tastes like it just came out of the oven. Still fresh. Yay! I used 1/4 cup of milk for 5 bananas, butter was melted. Baking time was close to 40 mins and yes, any longer and it would’ve burn!


 lisalisaj:

Do you have a thermometer for your oven b/c many are off by at least 50 degrees.


I bought an oven thermometer after a couple of cakes came out far more done than they ought to have been. At least now I know that the dial and the actual temp are 20 degrees (C ) different… and no more overbaked cake!
My win this week was finally seeming to get some sort of form back running, and posting my fastest time over 5k for the year so far at just over 28 minutes as part of a longer run. Not record breaking, but not bad pace after quite a lot of time off thanks to knee issues. That’s a great PR IMO.
I haven’t run for a few months. I want to get back out there bc I miss it. I go super early and no one is around.I learned to focus more on what I’m doing instead of taking break after break…I also took a break from social media and started spending less time on my phone. SUCH. A. WIN. My phone usually eats up my time slowly and I end up doing nothing I actually enjoy 
And since we’re talking about food, I baked some really good apple 'n oats muffins  


 lisalisaj:

I haven’t run for a few months. I want to get back out there bc I miss it.


I don’t usually run, but before all this virus stuff started I took Brazillion Jiujitzu twice a week, so I know how you feel.I wouldn’t call it a loss. It’s all learning. 
I’ve baked so many things and they have not turned out, and only I eat them. Haha.
Banana bread is tricky. 9” loaf pan, 55 min at 350 usually works. I’ve found that a darker metal pan works best—no ceramic or glass. Not too many bananas or liquid. Also I don’t over mix the wet and dry ingredients bc that messes with the gluten too much. I also put a strip of parchment paper in the greased pan so it’s easier to get out of the pan. I only started recently doing that. 
I have some gluten free flour and I’ve never baked with it. Curious to see how banana or pumpkin bread comes out. Probably flat and dense. I’m on my first 7 day streak!! Working towards 30+
This week has been my first experience ever coding, and I sometimes feel overwhelmed when I don’t understand what’s going on, but I just keep going on because I feel like it’s going to click eventually.I have made my Longest Steak ever of 64 Days . Also Today, i created a Repository and Pushed my First Code ever on Github. Yeahhhhhh  and all that Thanx to Codecademy. Because of Wonderful people like you… I forced myself to come and Study Every Single Day. You all motivated me and were with me when i overstudied . Also there’s something i want to say that less than 20 days are remaining of my Pro and i will come everyday to learn something new. I’m really Grateful that i got to meet all of you . I have never really been attached to anything in this World other than my Parents. But I will miss all of you . It has been an Honor knowing all of you.That’s Really Great to know @student31cs and believe me you won’t regret ever to come and study. A Tip From me…Don’t OverStudy and know when to Stop. I learned this through the Hard Way . May you Accomplish Everything in your Life .

107,What are your biggest struggles while you are learning to code?,30-Day Challenge,114,2.8k,"I am 27. I didn’t touch Mathematics at all since 2010 when I was 17. I have left it for 10 years. It feels so foreign to me now to use ‘logic’ and sometimes I really struggle to think fluently about writing systematic codes for a project.
Also because of Mathematics being quite foreign to me I sometimes have some irrational fear towards it.
That’s my biggest struggle. I am creating this thread to see if anyone has big struggles that they would like to share about and maybe some people will be able to provide useful advice to help. Thank you!My biggest struggle is to press on when feeling things are getting much harder than what I have learned so far.
Also I find it hard when I am coding and not see the results. I need something tangible that proofs me the things I do have an effect on the outcome.
For example I am currently working on the Ravenous project 107, I have written significant amounts of code now but I don’t see what it translates into. The app is not able to run yet.Definitely whitespace and spelling. I’m familiar with logic but trying to find my errors takes forever, and they’re always spelling/spacing mistakes.Syntax is pretty hard for me.  I get very frustrated when I get so close to solving a problem, but something very small that I overlooked is what causes errors.  The small details are what trip me up.  I also find that I “hit a wall” after a while, where progress slows down and it’s not as exciting as when you first started.  This is my third time trying to learn coding though, I used to slowly quit when I hit the wall.  Now that I’ve been through this a few times, I know not to do that this time.  It’s all about chipping away and practicing every day.  Not every day will be huge progress, but keeping consistent is what’s important.  I’ll look back at the end of 30 days and be proud.I have one single struggle that I have dealt with for YEARS: Consistency. I am an electrical engineer so the logical systems behind programming come somewhat naturally beyond syntax. Nonetheless I find it hard to stay consistent for long periods. I find that I allow life to get in the way. The daily reminders and streaks are great but ultimately, without an end-project in mind, the idea of learning computer science is outweighed by the laziness of getting the courses done.
This is similar to learning math in school. If you don’t have an application and work backward to develop the math skills, you won’t appreciate the process of learning the math. Programming and computer science is no different. It’s just a toolkit to accomplish some goal. The trick is to stick it out until the end and develop meaningful project ideas along the way.
Thanks for reading, I know there are many others in the same boat!the biggest struggle : when stuck and no one asked. I completely forget about what kind of HTML or CSS it is to open up the source.
often it happened days.Apply what you know about NAND gates to program logic and you’ll find a perfect fit. Then you can share that with us, the ones in the bleachers.I get in my own way all the time.
Guys, I went to a bootcamp and totally blew it. I feel like I learned nothing. Still can’t code.
So I’m starting all over again from HTML to see if I can teach myself and make it make sense.Syntax errors. Always the syntax errors.
This happens all the time, whether in Aptana Studio 3 or this site. Sometimes just because of spacing and little details I failed to reach the final goal. But I did sort of adjust to this problem, and I made sure that every single line is structured similiar to the examples and formats.
Still, for a teenager like me, syntax errors are horrible.It’s mostly the wording and how the instructions were phrased that always gets me frustrated. Just this last Project: Scrabble. On Step 12, there was no mention that I had to save the value to an empty dictionary. It was because of the word ‘input’ that was giving me a headache. I wasn’t sure if it wanted me to put in an input statement or something similar to that matter. It made me search the internet for viable solutions to the problem where the solution was just a simple one in the end. Same story here. I’ve tried all sorts of Online Bootcamps and halfway through I just rage quit.
I’m trying Codecademy now since it’s cheaper. Let us know how you get on. Let’s push each other to get through this @superproxy2020 Let’s do this. I’ve never wanted anything so bad in my entire life.Definitely working it out, logic can be hard. I have to press ‘Solution’ sometimes.
Going too far, too fast. Sometimes I move on through concepts while not having fully digested previous ones. Sometimes I take the time to go back and yay, problems solved. I think it might help sometimes because when I forget something, then go back and review it, it’s drilled in better. The other thing is when something hasn’t clicked and I just forget about it, but then years later I realize it just fits.
Complicated stuff. Since I find online resources to learn programming, it’s generally a pretty fluid process to learn, but sometimes there are things that are just way too far ahead in the path and I can’t find any good information on them.
My biggest struggle is having a clear vision of what the problem I’m trying to solve is…also, finding the WHY and the WHAT  FOR …that on the non tangible more abstract side of learning to code/program…(or learning anything else…)
Furthermore, as a total beginner and on the more technical, low level side of things, I struggle when there aren’t enough opportunities to repeat, repeat, and repeat (like a Kata or any form in martial arts) what I have just learned…I love the analysis and discovery part previous to engaging with any problem solving methodology (like programming), but I also need to get down to doing things with my hands many times, until it is internalised …so, lather, rinse repeat is important to me…
Then, if anyone can suggest resources and a somewhat clear path for accomplishing this, I’d be much grateful I feel you mate
I think the fear of solving logical expressions would cause
like a mental block to my brain My biggest struggles are consistency in studying, and logic.  I tried learning SQL a while back, then dropped it for 2 years.  Then I started HTML, CSS, and JS then dropped them for a year.  I never seem to get past basics, then I need to almost start over because I’ve forgotten what I learned.
I’ve worked in completely unrelated fields for the past 10 years, and I haven’t been in a math class for almost 15.  The logic of coding can be really hard and discouraging sometimes.  Then I read an article/watch a video from a self-taught programmer about their struggles, and it encourages me to keep trying.I get really discouraged- my husband has a degree in computer science and has worked as a software engineer/developer for over 20 years.  He thinks my questions are too basic, but sometimes I don’t know how to find the answer.  My degrees are in physics and math, so I understand the logic, but sometimes I just simply am lost.  Sometimes I don’t even understand what I am doing well enough to ask a question: I’m just lost.
I’m on day 26 of the 30 day challenge.  I started with C# because I need a higher paying job, but even though I am 2/3 done with the course, I don’t fully understand.  So, taking a page from how I best learn natural languages, now I’m working on C++.  C++ seems a lot easier; I’m hoping when I finish C++ and start over on C# that that will have helped.Wow, I never thought anyone was just like me!! I am exactly the same relating to your first point about going too fast!! I’ve picked up Python maybe 3 years ago (not on Codecademy) but am having to recomplete the course on Codecademy because I went so fast I forgot most of what I learned. I’m too goal oriented and go “yay, I got the exercise, NEXT!!” and complete so much I can’t remember it!!
Anyway, still working on that. I need to practice practice practice. But I’m glad someone understands @khalilnajjar Couldn’t agree more. I went to a High School tech school for electronics engineering, so I’m pretty similar with boolean logic (although not as experienced), and was never good at math in school. However I learned I enjoy it a lot when there’s something interesting to apply it to! The best recommendation I can give is not to just use Codecademy, but to make projects for yourself on the side "
108,Constantly running into bug!,Bug Reporting,5,672,"I use to really like codecademy but recently I keep running into bugs, even if I switch to different browsers.
Browsers where bugs occur: Chrome+Safari
Bug 1:
When I click on “resume” progress nothing happens, I have to go into the course list and click on the course manually;
Bug 2:
Sometime when I click run the code I just entered will disappear, making it impossible to change it for the next exercise;
Bug 3:
Sometimes where there are multiple steps in the same exercise, when I finish the first step I click run it will run through the whole thing and basically saying I get the second step wrong, etc.
Bug 4:
When I can’t get something right for a couple of times a window will show up to let me choose to either keep trying or “get code”, when I click “get code” nothing happens.
The consistency of the bug is outrageous and needs to be fix, otherwise the whole website feels like a half-baked site launched yesterday.
Thanks.These are somw of the bugs due to the course updates and remodeling of the site. I’m sure the codecademy engineers are working on it. In these forums we can help you when the problem is with your code or understanding of the topic.
To bring these issues to the attention of the Codecademy engineers, I recommend that you use the in-exercise bug reporting tool every time one of these problems occurs.  I know from my own experience that they are happening often with the new courses, but keep reporting as often as you can.I’m experiencing bugs 1-3 as mentioned above also. Bug 2 happens to me on every single task/instruction and is frustrating. I have submitted numerous bug reports. Have not tried the ‘Get Code’ button yet so cannot confirm I get bug 4.
Using Google Chrome Version 53.0.2785.143 m, Win 7 x64.Yep its happening to me also just when i get code or go back to other questions, the display code is still stuck on the last question i was on…I can’t use it in this state. But im shaw its because they are re modelling, but they could let us know so we don’t think its an abandoned website thats getting filled with bugs…I had the same problem for bug 2, now all my 20 lines of code is gone and i dont know what to do "

 Topic:  Coding Books 
There are plenty of online resources for coding.  When you need a quick answer, searching is usually the most efficient method.  Sometimes to learn a broader concept, a book can be more helpful.
Do you buy coding books to complement your learning? Yes No27votersShow results
Feel free to comment below or provide any recommendations on good coding book reads.Yep, big time!
Got books for all sorts… Some are just about the language (C-family, Python, Go, Kotlin, SQL…), and some are “application” books (covering automation, app development, frameworks, pen-testing applications and principles…)
Also got a handful of books relating to certs I’ve taken exams for, not all of which involve code…Yes, I buy lots of them, they really help me.Do online articles count as books?I have some Python books I got some years ago, but I don’t really buy coding books anymore.I don’t buy books but rather have a ton of bookmarks (all organized and categorized!) in chrome for articles and websites that I’ve found useful (including official documentation for python modules). 
I also don’t have space in my apartment for any more books! hahaha

I love to keep the links to articles I find useful in OneNote, it’s so satisfying to not have to look up the things I already spent hours looking for before That is a good idea, I might try that.Bookmarks-yes! I want books, but I never seem to get them…Not really, I find most people don’t buy books anymore.    Things change so quickly these days.  Yep. It’s actually kind of scary how quickly everything is moving towards digital. That’s what I find, most people don’t buy books these days.  I’m always torn between buying a book or just finding articles online.  There is just something I love about physically reading a book.


 coffeencake:

There is just something I love about physically reading a book.


Right? Unfortunately I’m too paranoid to go to any libraries, and school takes up a lot of my time.Yes! Of course, there are fantastic resources online for learning to code, but I really like having something physical, too. I recently bought the classic (so I’m told!) Clean Code, for example, which I’m looking forward to. And there are some digital-only titles which I’ve bought recently: Pure React (Dave Ceddia), which has had very good reviews, and Better Web Typography (Matej Latin).
So… yes, I like to complement my online learning with the slower pace of sitting down and reading through a book.I’m a bigger fan of online courses. I only read some of John Duckett’s books because it was recommended by CodecademyYes, I haven’t been to a library in a long while now too.Thanks for the recommendations.  I think that’s a good way of complementing our learning.  Keeping some classics on-hand for cozy reading moments One reason I also don’t read books is mainly because I already code many hours a day. So when I’m done, I wouldn’t want to read about coding. I feel like it’s good to like coding, and do it a lot, but when you’re done, you should try to be completely attached for it not to become an addiction I think this is a good point, but… right now, when I’m learning, I feel like I benefit from as much immersion as I can. Absolutely, I think it’s good to switch off from time to time, but I find that if I’m coding during the day, and reading about coding at night, even for an hour before I really switch off, then it really gets me motivated to get up in the morning and go again! I try not to read anything too challenging at night — maybe something I’m sort of familiar with, but know I could improve my understanding of.
I make notes throughout the day of resources I’d like to look at later, for example, and might skim them to see if there’s anything I’d like to really follow up in-depth.If I get a book, it has to be a digital version so that I can cmd+F (ctrl-F) what I need from it. For training/education I rely on online resources a lot more now than books. I usually keep an eye on Udemy for one of those site wide sales when every course is 10 bucks and get a few."
110,"Stuck in Basic Calculator (java)/ error: class, interface, or enum expected",Community,3,479,"Hi, I’m new and I’m also not a native speaker in English.
I am stuck in this task with the following error: class, interface, or enum expected.
That’s my code:

Calculator.java
public class Calculator{

public int add(int a,int b){
addition = a + b;
return addition;
 }
public int substract(int a,int b){
substraction = a-b;
This file has been truncated. show original 7







Would be great to get help!You forgot curly braces after your constructor which should be
public Calculator() {} 

And I think you need to consider zero-division error in the division and modulo function.
Using an if… else statement will do the trick! Hope this helps!The class interface or enum expected error is a compile-time error in Java which arises due to curly braces. Typically, this error occurs when there is an additional curly brace at the end of the program.I got pretty much the same error, plus an additional one for each method call. I had not forgot the {} at the constructor, but apparently I had them in the wrong place. My code was first this;
public class Calculator{

  public Calculator() {}

  public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  public int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
  }

  public int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
  }

  public int divide(int a, int b) {
    return a / b;
  }

  public int modulo(int a, int b) {
    return a % b;
  }
}
public static void main (String[] args) {

  Calculator myCalculator = new Calculator();

  System.out.println(myCalculator.add(5,7));
  System.out.println(myCalculator.subtract(45,11));
  System.out.println(myCalculator.multiply(5,7));
  System.out.println(myCalculator.divide(47,3));
  System.out.println(myCalculator.modulo(47,3));
}

i.e. I closed the class definition before the Main method. Here I got the errors, starting with the same one that OP got.
I changed the code, moving the last } before the Main method from line 26 to the last line, thus including the Main method in the definition of the Calculator class. This runs as expected.
My question: Why does the Main method need to be part of the class definition?
I learned that the Main method is always the entry point for any Java program (correct?), and when running one, the Main method should be the first thing that is encountered (correct?) while classes that are needed would typically be defined in a separate file each and imported to main.java.  In that case, the Main Method is not part of any custom-made class (correct?).
Also, it can run on its own when not inside a class - so why can’t it when we define a class further up in the file?"

112,Olivia Woodruff Portfolio,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,1,107,"Hi all 
Even though I already know HTML and CSS, I’m currently working through them as part of the Web Development pathway.
I’ve decided to put this post in the suggestions as there’s part of the course that feels like it doesn’t flow all that well.
In the HTML section, there was a heavy emphasis on semantic mark up, which is great in my opinion. For accessibility, I think we should all be more aware of how we are typing our HTML. One of the key points was to use the header, footer, nav tags instead of the way we were doing it for years and just sticking a class of header/footer/nav on a div.
Fast forward to the CSS course and the Olivia Woodruff Portfolio task. In the HTML mark up is the following.

The mark up shows a div with the class of header, something that in previous sections we were told not to do as it has no semantic meaning.
I really think this needs to be looked at and possibly changed as I don’t think it flows well and could potentially confused new users to html and css, especially after completing the html section.
Hope you are all well and busy studying. Wish you all the best and good health.I just finished this project, and noticed an error. In Step 6 it says "" Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more nicely. Set the color for h1 elements to Azure . When you do this, the color does not change to Azure, but rather the text is White. This even happens in the Codecademy tutorial video on YouTube, and the narrator just ignores the fact that the color doesn’t change. Kind of annoying.

113,Maybe a certificate for each course done in the career path?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,14,160,"Nothing much to say here, the topic says it all. I just think that some courses in the career path are worthy enough to have a certificate of it’s own. not sure if people agreeDo you have examples?
To be honest, I don’t think it’s necessary.
If I got a certificate in Javascript I’d say that was enough, not necessary to have a certificate in IF Statements then another in For Loops etc… as an example.
That’s just my opinion though!Welcome to the forums, @wujikwan12! Also, @dannygdev!  I think what I’m hearing @wujikwan12 say is, for example, they want a certificate for the Learn HTML course once they complete that portion of it in the Web Dev Path, as opposed to sections of a course (e.g. HTML Forms).yea exactly that, but as much as the content might be worthy enough i think a challenging exercises concluding the lessons  we’ve learned would make it even better.Hmm. We do offer a lot of challenge projects so that you can test your skills at the end of a module or course. Have you seen those? Here’s a list of them:




List of Challenge Projects Corner Bar


    Hello community! 
Update: 10/20/20

We have now incorporated the majority of challenge projects listed below within our new career paths and other paths, with the exception of the C++ challenge projects which are now in that course syllabus.  The remaining challenge projects will be added to syllabi in Q4 2020 alongside other upgrades, in part so that your completion % doesn’t change on you too often.   


In this post you’ll find a list of our challenge projects.  We’re overhaulin…
  

I think that feature is already up on the site.
For instance, I finished my Computer Science Path in which I completed courses like Learn Sorting Algorithms, Learn Data Structures, etc. And all those certificates are already available on my profile.
@wujikwan12 if certificate is appropriate for any section, then it is added to your profile as soon as you complete it in the career path. No need to worry about that.
BTW, welcome to the forums, you posted for the first time. Hope to see you soon again!There no certificate appearing to my profile, how can I address this. I already contact the codecademy. I’m taking DS career Path and I already at Data Viz but there are no certificates yet in my profile. I already clicked the ‘complete’ in the course path and clicked the view certificate but it does not appear in my profile.I believe that, as of right now, you will only receive one certificate for completing a career or skill path. You won’t receive certificates for any courses you completed inside those paths.
Can you confirm this @lilybird?That’s correct, @victoria_drSo when you just take the course first which is part of a career path, you’ll get a certificate? instead of choosing the career path first, you must enroll in a course that is related to your career path to get a certificate?


 pauliimath:

So when you just take the course first which is part of a career path, you’ll get a certificate?


It seems like so. This is one way to get the certificates for each course.



 pauliimath:

I’m not completely sure about this; I’ve never tried it.

I found a workaround though: after you’ve completed a course on the career path, simply go to the course’s syllabus; click on any lesson, quiz, or project; complete that module; and you’ll receive the certificate.“I found a workaround though: after you’ve completed a course on the career path, simply go to the course’s syllabus; click on any lesson, quiz, or project; complete that module; and you’ll receive the certificate.”
I already did this but there are still no certificates.Hello Ms. lily, Is there anything I need to contact to make my certificates appear in my profile?I don’t know if it’s some technical issue or what but I am able to see all the certificate of courses which are completed in career path at my profile page.Certificates can take up to 72 hours to appear.

116,Pro Path when the account switch from pro to regular,Community,3,56,"Hello everyone,
I have a simple question, do we still have access to a COMPLETED Pro path and their project when our account switch from PRO to Regular account ?
Because, I don’t really saved all the exemple project for every Lessons like HTTP etc etc so I have to know…
Thanks you by advance for your answer
AntoninHi there, welcome to the forums.
As I understand it, if your Pro subscription runs out you will lose access to all Pro content - so any Pro-only quizzes and projects will be inaccessible if you only have a free account.
If you want to keep the projects you built as part of a Pro path, like the Web Development path, then you should make sure to save a copy of your code to your computer before your subscription runs out. Hi,
thank you @thepitycoder for your answer.
So I guess I have to take one day to check every project in a Pro Path to see if I have made a copy of it then 
AntoninI think some of the projects are designed to be done “off platform”, so you may well have a copy of those already.
Also, it’s worth keeping in mind that you can regain access to any Pro material - projects, quizzes etc - at any point in the future by re-subscribing to Pro; your work isn’t deleted when the subscription lapses. "
117,How can I know how much time I have spent in CodeCademy?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",5,209,"Hey, since we’re data typers, gatherers and drivers: does anyone know how to translate badges or points into actual time (hours, minutes)?
It will be great so you can realize your timing, what took you to get there, what you have ahead.
Cheers to all the learners!My 2 cents: I think it’s generally considered antithetical to the process. The reasons are that for one people inherently learn at a different pace, and it’s more valuable to retain the information rather than tick the box of getting it right the first time. I can give the personal example that even though I completed the cs path, I don’t consider myself to have an adequate grasp of all the data structures (at a necessary level at least). Had I rushed it, I feel like I’d be even less secure with that knowledge.
However, you could track your own progress and make your own conclusions. There is value in that.I think @toastedpitabread is correct, from a pedagogical viewpoint.
I think what I’m hearing from @kikkong, though, is that while getting into the groove of learning, it would be nice to get a little positive feedback, understand the relationship between effort-in and outcomes, and to start being able to estimate what you’ve got ahead.
What our team of volunteer super users and moderators know really well is that the learning process looks suuuuper different for everyone, so a solution like codifying badges/points into time spent wouldn’t really function as intended; there’s too much variance across the experiences.
But it doesn’t make the problem you’re facing any less salient! You want to know what progress you’re making, and you want a clearer path forward.
I hope you continue to come back and give us updates as it becomes clearer.
PS, very nice art in your portfolio.Hey @alyssavigil, hey @toastedpitabread,
Thank you very much for your replies!
Yes, @alyssavigil is totally right: I was framing it just from the ‘understanding’ point of view.
Somehow I managed to portray myself as an ‘über-performance-nerd’, which doesn’t have anything to do with reality: I even think, coming from a bit from sport performance, that rest days (like absolute rest, like aloha shirt, cooler in hand, and just letting time roll, kind of rest) are a must, and that time is just one parameter more. Even in sport science, no one uses time anymore as the sole indicator of the training load/intensity.
‘Effort’ is the key, and that’s unique for each personal surroundings, mindset, habits, routine, and many other things.
I’m even trying to get the 30 day streak, and I’m not sure that’s useful from a learning point of view; but I like to experience things myself and make my own mind –I’ll keep you posted on that.
I was just asking if there was a way of getting the parameter “time” into the equation.
All the best to you all.
Much love from Amsterdam ,

 Solved by victoria_dr in post #6 


                Though I mostly use note-taking in areas other than coding, I recommend you take notes by hand. Or, at least to write out the most important points you want to remember by hand. This has been well-studied (here’s an article by the BBC). 
You might also find it helpful to write out your thought proce…
              
It might help explain why I’m still a beginner… I’ve never taken notes. Only practiced.
Reading is how we take notes. Read the documentation. Read articles. Try out everything you read about. Explore every new built-in to its fullest. That’s the note taking I do. The paper only comes out when I want to explore a problem and need to sketch it out. Problem is that’s where many learners seem to put the paper and pencil away.I make notes using Notion.   There are many others. You can use like One Note, Google keep etc
Commit your code daily so that you know what you are doing  You can always go back and check
as this helps u in remembering and gives you confidence boost as well.
Happy CodingI’ve looked at your achievements in your profile and it’s really great that you’ve accomplished so much without even making notes.
Practice is another important aspect of writing good code and problem solving. I also try to sketch up plans and break down problem but when trying advance concepts it really becomes a pain. That’s why I think that notes would be helpful to review and look that if what I’ve learned before would be helpful here or not.Online note keeping applications are good but I prefer having hard copies.Though I mostly use note-taking in areas other than coding, I recommend you take notes by hand. Or, at least to write out the most important points you want to remember by hand. This has been well-studied (here’s 1 an article by the BBC).
You might also find it helpful to write out your thought process while working on projects. Coding can be practical and is concerned with the actual writing of code. Writing out the steps you take to solve each problem will help develop your critical thinking skills and enable you to both remember information and learn how to apply that information.The notes are the online documentation. What more do we need? Many very capable minds have gone into creating that resource. Are my notes ever going to equal them? No. My examples will help give them concrete meaning, though, so that’s where I pour my energy.TBH it takes me a lot of time to understand the documentation. 
I really appreciate people who can figure out what’s even written there!Every teacher or professor that I ever came to love had one thing in common in their teaching method… They interpreted. We were given examples that were then interpreted according to a given concept of the day.
It was not the rote material on the board, but what they added to their description and the little insights as to their relation to other concepts. I loved those teachers. Throw the book away. That’s not what we’re here to learn. We’re here to learn how to read that book and derive knowledge and insight through active participation with its content.Documentation is one of the most important (if not the most important) tools a developer can use. It’s necessary to learn how to make use of it. Here, I’ve found a video by Codecademy that may be of help.
How To Use Developer Documentation
Then begin to admire yourself, soon enough. It truly is where it all begins. There are no flight attendants on this journey, just a manual, and once you have code facing the outside world, you are the pilot. Learn to read documentation. Priority number one.To ignore documentation is to disrespect the discipline one seeks to engage in. That is counterproductive and leads to no good end. A Primer starts us off with well documented and teachable fundamentals. That’s what program language documentation is. Maybe not the Nick and Jane variety we got as six year olds, but still much the same thing.I didn’t mean to disrespect but it’s just that documentation is hard for me to understand and interpret what’s written over there. But if it’s so essential to read the documentation then I would surely give some time reading and using the documentations available. I actually didn’t knew about this video. Thanks for providing the link. I hope it helps me to understand documentations much better and it woud be easy for me to read docs.Nothing helps understanding documentation better than reading it. Videos can never replace that experience.I find taking notes on the more conceptual elements of programming more helpful than trying to take notes on everything. I find it more useful for me to have a highly organized bookmarks folder, where I can easily find the documentation for whatever language or framework I’m trying to use, as well as helpful articles and tutorials. That way I don’t have to google the things I know I probably won’t remember, or spend time trying to find where I wrote it down–I know it’s in the folder.For me and my learning process I find that it helps to write/take notes. I have notebooks filled with them and color-coded tabs with the subject matter listed (Python: Dictionaries, functions,  SQL: JOINS, etc.). I refer back to them often too. TBH, I’m a office supply store nerd. I like notebooks, pens, highlighters and the whole process of selecting them. I like organizational items as well. 
Additionally, I also have several bookmarks and folders of official documentation (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, etc.) and links that I’ve found helpful from StackOverflow (or whatever) for the times I’ve been stuck and I sought out an explanation for an error. Sometimes reading how other ppl have solved errors is enlightening too…b/c everyone’s brains work differently and maybe you finally see/understand something that you hadn’t before.
And, as @mtf said, interpretation of concepts (& documentation) with examples that make sense to me is also important. Because if you can explain a concept out loud and to someone else then you’ve learned it. I usually keep notes on long and important lessons that can be easily forgotten, I usually don’t for ones that I find are easy to remember/simple.I also will sometimes print out things that I can see myself frequently referencing (this git cheat sheet comes to mind 2). Having a physical copy of things sometimes is helpful!@armaan_barak seriously, the greatest course on learning I had in my life:

If you’re looking for something easy to do, look elsewhere because this is definitively not it. Also, don’t confuse this with the impossible. The point is not to discourage you but to give you an honest view.
You will hear a lot of people telling you what language to do first, but that is their opinion. Just because it worked for them doesn’t mean it’s going to work for you.
Everybody hates this, but I’m going to answer your question with another question. What is your end goal?
If your end goal is to get a job in programming and make a lot of money, your best bet is to look at the most common languages. The good news is, someone already did the homework for you 190.
Pick the most common language, it will maximize your chances of getting a job. However, the market is very competitive so you’ll have to stand out. If you’re still looking for the easy way out, then pick the least popular language and you’ll have less competition.
Have a different goal in mind? Here’s a little summary of what language is good for what, mind you this is not all there is to it but it’s basic enough.


Front-end web development:  JavaScript, TypeScript

Back-end web development:  JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby

Mobile development:  Swift, Java, C#

Game development:  C++, C#

Desktop applications:  Java, C++, Python

Systems programming:  C, Rust

If your goal is to integrate with embedded devices, then you’re looking at C++ or Assembly. If you think the Codecademy courses are hard, Assembly is going to make you cry. Yes, it’s hard. No, it’s not impossible.
Can’t settle on a goal? Then the answer is easy. It doesn’t matter.
Why doesn’t it matter? Because what you need is first-hand experience. If you can’t make up your mind, pick one at random. You’ll gain some experience and eventually will come up with a goal.I would say that TypeScript works much better on the back-end than the front-end.
Type checking provides minimal real value on the front-end, but a lot of value on the backend.
Also, thanks to React Native, 5 JavaScript is a totally viable way to do Mobile Development.  And Electron 2 has done a great job of making JavaScript a good option for desktop development.Oh jeez. What happened to HTML and CSS as front-end? Not much changed in that regard, html & css still exists and are still used
but making a dynamic web application requires a lot more then just html & css. We can even make hybrid mobile apps with Javascript (+libraries), html and css.HTML is not Touring Complete, therefore, not technically a language. It is still a must-know for front-end development though.
CSS3 is Touring Complete,  but it’s also something you should know as a front-end developer. I haven’t seen any position where the only thing you do is CSS, it should be another tool in your toolbox.
Valid points, updating the post.
EDIT
Hmmm, for some reason it won’t let me edit the original post. But your comments is registeredThe first language I learned was Python, that really helped me get a basic understanding of programming.


 peachesmotorsports:

I thoroughly disagree. I visited this site for the first time when I was in school to learn some more about programming on the side. I am now doing my Bachelor in CS. The entire notion that you need to be a genius to learn how to code is ridiculous. I have taught in Coder Dojos and I never saw a kid that had a “too low IQ to learn how to program”.
Finally, on the choice of programming language, it is rather easy:
Choose a language that enables you to build stuff you are passionate about not a language that you think will help you in a few years.
-Why?
Because there is no better way to learn the ins and outs of a language then thru actually using it in projects. And doing projects you are passionate about will make the hours you put in a lot more bearable than when doing stuff you are not passionate about.I only disagree with one thing “you need a high IQ”. Not trieI’m afraid you read that wrong. I’m not saying you need to have a high IQ to learn how to code, I’m saying this won’t be easy unless you have a high IQ.
If you have a high IQ then learning languages will be easy. Therefore, you don’t really need to be part of this community. The point is that much like anything else out there, this is not an easy journey, you need to work hard at it as long as you stay in this field. People think they can get a job as a coder after taking one of the courses here, what I try to make clear is that that is not true.
The answer to the question is in fact not as easy as you think, I wrote this post because I constantly see people asking the very same question. What you say is true, you need to pick a language that helps you build something you’re passionate about. What is not true is the common knowledge of what language is best suited for what, which is the purpose of the post."
122,Codecademy Helped Me Get a Job! ,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",14,1.3k,"I started learning how to program six months ago, and had next to no programming experience before joining Codecademy Pro. I worked my way through about 75% of the Web Development course over four months.
Then, I had the opportunity to learn Python through a free five-week course with Stanford because of COVID-19. After the course, I did a quick 3-hour crash tutorial on YouTube learning Flask.
Yesterday, I started my first day as a Backend Software Engineer at a small startup in Silicon Valley. It’s possible! Thank you Codecademy, and especially the supportive community here.Congratulations!! I just started 4 days ago so your post is definitely motivational!That is pretty awesome, congratulations! I’ve personally just started and similar to yourself starting with little to no experience with the hope of pursuing a change in career somewhere down the line!
Best of luck to you and your new career!
P.s. Thanks for the motivational boost@rpgbx that’s really Wonderful to hear. I’m currently studying Data Science Path and it’s been over 1 month and completed 50% of the Path. I’m also studying hard so i can make Codecademy and my Parents Proud.  Thanx for sharing such great Story with us. May you achieve success  in your Life.Wish you good luck for future endeavors That’s Awesome… let’s us know it’s possible, thanks for sharingI am looking to start again and hopefully get a new career at the end.  I have coded a website years ago at school, and have dabbled in lua for a game I play.  I also did the codecademy HTML course (free) a while ago and found it to have gaps.  I am now considering going pro as there seems to be a lot more stuff there…Is front-end needed before becoming as backend engineer ?Not necessarily. You may choose to do one or the other, or both.
Depends what it is you want to do.i see , but full-stack or software engineer would be more on the top?That’s definitely a great feat, and I encourage you to continue o your adventure in coding. It takes luck to have an opportunity, but how you follow up on that opportunity, is important like you did, which is great! Congratulations and wishing you the best of luck in the future! If you can, and do have the time, could you check out my posts in Careers,Journeys and Stories called, “Coding isn’t hard, it’s like Rocket Science” and “How Anthropology, Soccer, and Women matter to Coding”. As a pro coder, I could really your insight, and it would really be helpful.Congratulations on your new job!That’s amazing and motivating!  I’ve started the front end engineer path and I’m 18% complete so far.  I’ve excited to see what I can do after 75% completion. CongratsNice work, time for me to start testing my skills on Coding. Seeing things like these make me feel like I can set/complete tasks I don’t think I can do e.g. I have no experience now but I will soon.Wow that’s great news. All the best"
123,Stack Overflow’s 2020 Insights Survey,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",4,81,"Howdy,
I thought you all might find this interesting:
Stack Overflow’s 2020 Insights Survey 11
This link goes directly to the salary survey portion of the study, but the study, in its entirety, has a lot of very interesting information about coders.  Enjoy!Cool! Thanks for posting. I found the 2019 results quite insightful. I always like looking at the demographic information the most.Wow, out of 65,000 developers that participated in the survey only 7.7% were women in a professional developer role (compared w/91.7% men). 
Seems we have a way to go. OR, more women need to participate in the survey (ie: better outreach).
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#developer-profile-genderYeah, it’s pretty amazing the amount of information they’re getting from their very dedicated user base!
I did not see that RE: women in the coder workforce!  You’re right, perhaps more needed to participate.  Or, I wonder if women who DO code participate less on a site like Stack Overflow where male participation dominates.  I know that when I participate in some SysAdmin groups ( my other profession => AWS / Azure cloud, networking, linux) there are very few women, and honestly, the men are kind of cheesy and I wouldn’t blame the women who do not want to participate.   i dunno…The problem that I have with their annual survey is their sample population. I know they stated that they reached out on different channels (rather than just using their platform…but still).
For me, I don’t participate on S.O. I read, consume and observe how others interact. Mostly b/c the query has already been fully answered and also b/c I find the users on the site a bit intimidating.
It’s still good info on the population they surveyed. I also like the visuals. They seemed to have improved this year.
This is…predictable though:

 stetim94:

room.roll is iterable? but it only contains one element?


Right, and adding more data creates more elements. My issue now is how to iterate over the keys of each dictionary.
for i in range(len(room.roll)):
    for key in room.roll[i]:
        print key, room.roll[i][key]

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 50, in <module>
TypeError: 'Student' object is not iterable
Student is not a dict, and it has no keys.
If you want Student to be a type of dict, you could do something like this …
class Student(dict):
    def __init__(self, name, homework, quizzes, tests):
        self[""name""] = name
        self[""homework""] = homework
        self[""quizzes""] = quizzes
        self[""tests""] = tests
    def show(self):
        for key in self:
            print(key, self[key])
    
lloyd = Student(""Lloyd"",[90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0],[88.0, 40.0, 94.0],[75.0, 90.0])
lloyd.show()

Output …

homework [90.0, 97.0, 75.0, 92.0]
quizzes [88.0, 40.0, 94.0]
tests [75.0, 90.0]

However, if you iterate through a Student, as above, the order of the output might not always be the same.

I think it is actually a matter of your using a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, where there are a variety of syntaxes for accessing properties of an object …
lloyd.name
lloyd[""name""]

It is common for programmers to inadvertently carry a feature from one language into a program written in another language.

really nice, good job The Python 3 linter on repl.it issues the following caution on this line:
  def __init__(self, sid, name, homework, quizzes, tests):

Too many arguments (6/5)
__init__ method of base class 'dict' is not called

I’ve done some digging around but don’t have a clear idea how to address this issue. Can anybody offer an explanation, please?

https://repl.it/G0AD/6 2
Add this as the first line within the __init__ method of Student …
        super(Student, self).__init__()

It calls the __init__ method of the dict type, which initializes the new instance, self, as an empty dict. Thereafter, you can initialize the four items based on the parameters, as you do now.


 appylpye:

super(Student, self).__init__()


Still telling me there are too many arguments. What am I missing, here?Following is another approach.
Remove dict as the base class …
class Student():

Revise the __init__ method as follows to initialize an internal dict …
  def __init__(self, sid, name, homework, quizzes, tests):
    self.data = dict()
    self['sid'] = sid
    self['name'] = name
    self['homework'] = homework
    self['quizzes'] = quizzes
    self['tests'] = tests

Add a __setitem__ and a __getitem__ method, so that Student objects can be accessed via keys, as with a dict …
  def __setitem__(self, key, item):
    self.data[key] = item
  def __getitem__(self, key):
    return self.data[key]

Leave everything else as is.Thanks, again, @appylpye. Both of your approaches work fine, but I’m still scratching my head over the too many arguments linter caution. Is there some kind of rule in Python that limits the number of arguments in __init__?
After reading some more I see it is a caution that may indicate refactoring is needed to lighten the load, and not really a limit issue. Here’s my first kick at that can…
  def __init__(self, args):
    self.data = dict()
    self['sid'] = args[0]
    self['name'] = args[1]
    self['homework'] = args[2]
    self['quizzes'] = args[3]
    self['tests'] = args[4]

Student((sid, name, homework, quizzes, tests))  # named tuple

I haven’t worked much with *args and **kwargs. How would they be applied in this case?Using *args
Change the __init__ method of Student to this …
  def __init__(self, *args):
    self.data = dict()
    self['sid'] = args[0]
    self['name'] = args[1]
    self['homework'] = args[2]
    self['quizzes'] = args[3]
    self['tests'] = args[4]

Using **kwargs
Change the __init__ method of Student to this …
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self.data = dict()
    self['sid'] = kwargs['sid']
    self['name'] = kwargs['name']
    self['homework'] = kwargs['homework']
    self['quizzes'] = kwargs['quizzes']
    self['tests'] = kwargs['tests']

… and change the add method of Teacher to this …
  def add(self, name, homework, quizzes, tests):
    sid = len(self.roll)
    self.roll.append(Student(sid=sid, name=name, homework=homework, quizzes=quizzes, tests=tests))


With the **kwargs solution, you could vary the positions of the arguments when you instantiate a Student, if you want.Following is another version of the __init__ method for Student, using **kwargs, that would allow you to choose, on the fly, the number and names of the arguments that you supply when you instantiate a Student …
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self.data = dict()
    for key in kwargs:
        self[key] = kwargs[key]

If you do this, you can arbitrarily supply categories of grades and other data to a Student. However, you would then need to make sure that all the other methods have the flexibility to accommodate the variety of data that might be supplied to a Student object.Thank you, once again, Glenn… After going over the reading and putting together all the pieces in your previous posts I’ve got the Student class down to the following…
class Student(dict):
  criteria = {'homework': 0.1, 'quizzes': 0.3, 'tests': 0.6}
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super(Student, self).__init__()
    for key in kwargs:
      self[key] = kwargs[key]
  def average(self):
    weighted_average = 0
    for key in self.criteria:
      x = self[key]
      weighted_average += sum(x) / len(x) * self.criteria[key]
    return weighted_average
  def grades(self):
    print (""\nGrades for,  {:s}"".format(self['name']))
    for key in self.criteria:
      x = self[key]
      y = [""{:0.1f}"".format(item) for item in x]
      print (""{:>10s}: "".format(key), "", "".join(y))

Given all the inputs from previous, the following calls,
room.roll_call()
room.show()
room.get_averages()
print (room.class_average())

give these outputs…
Roll Call
         0:  Lloyd
         1:  Alice

revision #9
Nice work, Roy.
There is a special hazard, however, with using **kwargs. The caller of the function might omit a named argument, supply an extra named argument that should not be there, or might misspell the name of an argument. In the case of a Student object, this would lead to either some data not getting included in the computation of the average or a KeyError. To make the instantiation process more friendly, it might be best to raise an exception accompanied by some informative description, if there is either a missing named argument or an extra one.
See the following …
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    # check for missing grade category
    for key in self.criteria:
      if key not in kwargs:
        raise ValueError(""missing category: {:s}"".format(key))
    # check for invalid grade category
    for key in kwargs:
      if key not in (list(self.criteria.keys()) + [""name""]):
        raise ValueError(""invalid category: {:s}"".format(key))
    # arguments are fine; proceed
    super(Student, self).__init__()
    for key in kwargs:
      self[key] = kwargs[key]

125,"Day in the Life: Voniel Brown, Codecademy Software Engineering Apprentice","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,1.2k,"Hey y’all! For this month’s Day in the Life, we’re featuring Voniel Brown, a software engineer apprentice at Codecademy! Voniel shares with us how after college he left finance to pursue something more meaningful to him – coding. When Voniel is not coding, he enjoys listening to sci-fi/fantasy audiobooks, taking morning walks, and learning something new in the ever-changing world of technology.
Meet Voniel! 

Tell us a little about yourself.
Hi everyone! My name is Voniel Brown, and I’m a software engineering apprentice at Codecademy. I was born in Jamaica but I moved to the US when I was 8 years old and now live in Brooklyn. I love listening to audiobooks specifically sci-fi/fantasy, my favorite series right now is the Stormlight Archive. Before becoming a software engineer, I graduated with a finance degree which I then realized it was not what I wanted to explore as a career. After attending a Bootcamp to learn how to become an engineer I started at Codecademy in September.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
During college, I was a member of the National Association of Black Accountants, and its motto of “Lifting as we Climb” always resonated with me. I wanted to make sure that I had a career as I grow and develop, I can help others around to achieve the same success that I have. Codecademy is the perfect company to achieve my goal and live as close to the motto as possible.
Did you always want to be a Software Engineer?
I was always fascinated by how technology connected people together and made so many things that were thought to be impossible a possibility. When I was younger it was always a mystique to me. My real interest in becoming a software engineer peeked when I was in high school and one of my friends introduced me to c++. It was truly fascinating to see the programs that he wrote, and it was especially amazing to help him work on his robot projects. After that experience showed me the possibilities that software engineering offered. As well as the thrill of building something and seeing it work, I knew I wanted to become a software engineer.
What are the best aspects about working as a Software Engineer?
One of the best aspects of working as a software engineer is that no two days are ever usually the same. Each new day provides an opportunity to try something new, even if you stuck on the same problem. There are often many different ways to solve an issue or squash a bug. I find it exhilarating to explore the different ways to find the best solution. It is also very fulfilling to see your work come together and your code is deployed to production.
What are the worst aspects about working as a Software Engineer?
One of the worst aspects of software engineering is that it is very easy to feel imposter syndrome. It is a wide and expansive field with so many new things to learn that at times you might feel like you don’t know enough or there is something that you are missing. It is also very easy to lose track of time, especially when you have a bug that you are on the verge of solving.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
The Epstein drive from the Expanse. With it I would be able to travel the stars hopefully avoiding the protomolecule. When I was younger I wanted to be an aerospace engineer to make the spaceships that would allow humans to colonize other planets.
Do you have any advice for the learners?
When there is something that you truly can’t understand, don’t be afraid to seek out help. There were many times during my bootcamp that I was completely stumped by a problem. I was afraid to ask questions because I wrongfully believed that it would make me look silly that I could not understand. I was constantly banging my head against the wall because I could not understand on my own. I finally realized that I did not need to perfectly understand everything. There were people that were willing to help me in my journey. The more questions that you ask the better your understanding will be.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Building a project with Golang. While our course on Go was an amazing introduction to the language I wanted to get more hands-on experience using the language within our platform. I would love to see more hands-on projects with Go, especially with our new portfolio projects.
What does a typical day look like for you?
I tend to wake up early in the morning which I used to hate but now I learned to make the best of it. After waking up I like to read bits of the news while eating breakfast. Since I am currently working from home it is very easy to stay in my room all day. So after breakfast sometimes I like to go out for a walk to the park to get some fresh air and sunlight, clear my head and get ready for the rest of the day.
After a quick shower, it’s right around time for my team to post our daily standup to get a sense of each member’s progress on our tickets. I always try to carve out time to explore a new part of the codebase to try to learn something new every day. With the rest of the day reserved for working on my individual ticket or any team meetings, pairing sessions that might come up.

126,What was your win this week?,Random,7,94,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not!  

Did you participate in a hackathon?
Did you finally get around to cleaning up your desk/work area?
Did you help someone else understand something?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! Coding-related: I finished the Dictionaries part on the DS path (with the new content added to the DS path, I had to go back and finish it up) including the Medical Ins. project in the dictionaries module. Getting stuff done, slowly but surely!  
Non-coding: I continued to make cooking and meal prep a priority rather than just an afterthought. Made some really tasty veg chili. (even though the temps were in the mid-70’s this past week in NYC.  )


 lisalisaj:

Did you finally get around to cleaning up your desk/work area?


Funny, I just sat down after cleaning the enormous mess I had on my desk (my creative mess got out of control).
Coding related: I DID IT! I finally finished the Python 3 course! It really feels good to be consistent with something and not leave things half-done 
Non-coding related: For my birthday, I got the “The Art of Frozen 2” book. I’m also going to get the one of Into The Spiderverse, but it sadly didn’t arrive on my brithday lol. I was super excited, I never thought I would actually get an art book. It was one of those things I always saw on the Internet and I was like “Ah, it would be so cool if I had one of those.”. But deep down I thought I would never actually get to OWN ONE AND HOLD IT WITH MY OWN HANDS OMGGGG
sorry for my enthusiasm  It’s been a week of Angular + C# experience for me  Can’t stop learning and exploring!I’ve tried to start a new course, but it didn’t go too well.Coding-related- I am 38% into the Data Science! I was set back a bit because of the new content, and doing like 4 Medical Insurance Projects in a row kind of annoyed me lol. I also am learning more Git and Jupyter Notebook, so that’s great.
Non-coding related- I’ve been practicing jumping more and more on my rollerblades and I’m getting pretty good. I’m running for NJHS President in my school, so wish me luck lol. Also, I finished season 11 of Ninjago, and I’m planning on re-watching Mob Psycho (just for Reigen).


 h1lo:

Wait, and have you watched ALL seasons up until 11? I only have seasons 1&2 on Netflix, then I found some other season (I think 9 or 10) on YouTube…so I’VE MISSED MANY SEASONS AND I CANT FIND THEM ANYWHERE  



 h1lo:

Did you just accidentally call me out? My desk has been begging for a clean-up, buttttt I’m lazy.


Hah, literally same here, but I share a room with my sister and she’s quite organized…so she will scold me when I have a mess until I clean it up

130,Can Codecademy enable the courses to be loaded into the ‘Education’ section of Linkedin?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,1,42,"Currently we are able to load our courses into the ‘certification’ section. But alot of other courses allow you to load into the ‘education’ section which hold more weight. Could Codecademy look into this?

WillThat’s a LinkedIn functionality issue.
Do you mean have Codecademy as part of the dropdown list when you start filling in that part of the template? You can add any school even if it’s not listed.
Also, that section is more about longer programs–college, university, bootcamps, etc. rather than singular courses.
Certifications and credentials are nice but if one can back them up with a portfolio/website, that holds more weight in the eyes of potential employers."

Well, it depends on what you’re learning style is. Would it help to take notes–handwritten or online?
Code a little bit every day and make sure you understand the concepts presented before moving on. If you get stuck, it’s okay to click on “get solution” but also make sure you understand the solution.  It’s a marathon, not a sprint 
If you get really stuck, search the forums here or google. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, so, know when to take a break. You’re learning a new language and it will take some time to be able to fully “speak” it.

Week 1 day 2Hello everyone. I’m currently work and study night tuition (online), meanwhile I accidentally viewed this website three days ago and tested it (for free). I heard about Python years ago and think it’s hard to learn, but I think this website give simple and straightforward guide to learn. Cool stuff, so I just sign up for Pro version.
Stay hungry stay foolish, new thing to learn everyday Pay money, a good motivation to push you forward. Because you paid it already, you force yourself to learn. I don’t like money being the solution, but I have to agree, that does really works well.My simple tips for everyone here. just write down or copy/paste the review at the end of every lesson it will help you to remember everything that you have learned after one week or month.Keep going! this is my first week too !!!

132,Add course to linkedin profile,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",15,7.5k,"There is any way to add a completed course to your personal profile on Linkedin?
Thanks!Hi @silviavdh, welcome to the forum.
If you want to list the course on your LinkedIn profile, you can do so by editing your LinkedIn profile directly.
As far as I know, there’s no “Add to LinkedIn” button for any of the courses.
To add the course, you can:

Go to LinkedIn, and log in.
Click the Me icon at the top of the LinkedIn homepage.
Click View Profile.
Click Add profile section, and then under “Accomplishments” find the Courses section.
You can add the details of the course here.

So, there is no certificate verification for linkedin? Any plans to add it? any updates?This is one of the first things I was keen to do also, could not find a away to download the certificate to add manually to Linkedin.I added the link to my profile as the credential URL.

I ended up with 3 lessons certificates + 1 certificate for the path after completing Web Dev career path - is that the same for the rest of you?


During the course of the Web Development Path, you do in fact complete the material from a couple of stand-alone courses. Hence, your multiple certificates. Yes, I am aware 
But since it’s actually 14 courses packed into the path, I was wondering if I should have gotten more than the 3+1 certificates…


 pywhiz00727:

But since it’s actually 14 courses packed into the path, I was wondering if I should have gotten more than the 3+1 certificates…


There may be 14 sections in the Web Development Career Path, but they aren’t all individual courses in their own right.  Some of them are, but others are parts of a larger course. As _31337 stated out, this is a very basic thing for any student who wants to show your accomplishment at Linkedin. Any plans to add the shareable certificate?Hi, welcome to the forums.
If you’re referring to the ability to add the course certificates to LinkedIn, I’m not aware of any plans to add that functionality. I don’t work for Codecademy, though.
(If you wanted to list that you’d completed one or more Codecademy courses on your LinkedIn, personally I would suggest they’re more at home in the Courses section than Certifications. This is, of course, simply my opinion.)You can Download the Certificates and the Link to them in Linkedin after adding your Course like this

Okay, now compare the line above to the solution. Can you spot the issue?The reason why your code doesn’t work is because they want you to use the -= daysOff.

I would love to see some content around implementing WCAG 2.0 standards and using things like aria-labels to facilitate screen reading. It is really always surprising to me how badly a lot of web content performs from an accessibility standpoint so I think there would be a lot to gain by training people in accessible web design early on.Welcome to the forums!
There is a little section on accessibility, aria-labels, and screen readers in the Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages skill path. I do agree there should be more, though. Having it’s own standalone course (especially if that course could be accessible to non-Pro users) would be amazing.I haven’t seen a lot of people implement it, our leadership keeps putting that off because we happen to be somewhat compliant by chance (we have a blind beta user who was able to sign up and start using the app with zero help, they assume we’re compliant but we aren’t). I’m more on the QA side, if you need a tool to verify it use Pa11y 1.Thanks! I’ll be sure to check that out!"

You took the course, you passed, you think you’re ready to take on the world, but you have no idea what it’s like out there. What will you have to deal with when you’re on the job?
First of all, getting a job after taking a Codecademy course is not as easy as it sounds so, congratulations! Here’s all the crap you’re going to have to deal with:

If you haven’t noticed already, most, if not all of the job postings for developers have the words “fast-paced environment”. This is 100% true.


Deadlines are always tight
You’re constantly being asked why it’s taking so long
A bug was reported in production, you need to fix it ASAP. Drop whatever you’re doing in order to fix it, but you can’t miss the deadline for the sprint either
You’re not directly asked or told to work extra hours, but it is suggested it needs to happen so you can meet the deadlines (take one for the team)

No matter how organized they say they are or what kind of development methodology they follow, you’ll always be short on time. You need to learn fast, code fast, fix issues fast. For some people, this is very stressful. If you can’t deal with it, it’s not worth putting your health at risk. Sometimes things do go according to plan, but most of the time its chaos.

100% code coverage.

You’re going to be asked to have 100% code coverage. What does this mean? It means you need to write unit tests for your code. This needs to be part of your deliverable and your estimate. Is it a good practice? Absolutely. Will you ever actually get to 100% code coverage? ■■■■ no. Why? see point #1, the bottom line is you won’t have time because you have more work to do.
Yes, you can make crappy unit tests that will make it look like you have 100% test coverage but in reality, it never happens. It takes too long, and no company ever has the time for it.

You’re going to make mistakes, own them.

You’re going to make mistakes. Either you wrote a bad function or you misinterpreted the requirement (I’ve talked about reading comprehension before). The feature is not going to work as expected, someone might find out before you deploy, or a user will find the problem in production. It happens all the time. Own it, learn from it, fix it, move on.
If you have a good QA team working with you, they’ll catch it before it’s deployed. This is not always the case, so don’t rely on it.

Your work might be scrapped.

You’ve been working on the app for months, you put in a lot of hard work and you’re very proud of what you’ve done. Then one day a decision comes down from upper management and you have to redo half the thing. Sounds crazy? It’s not, I lost count of how many times this has happened to me, I’m going through it at this very moment. After 2 years of work, we’re being asked to change the whole thing.
You’re going to be upset, your morale will be non-existent, you won’t want to go to work. Get over it, it happens all the time. Unless you’re in a leadership position capable of negotiating, you need to learn to do what you’re told. Some companies do value input from the employees (if you’re in such a place, let me know…), most of the time they don’t. Keep your head down, keep coding.

Keep learning.

I’ve said this before many times, you never stop learning. Professional development is a must. Ideally, your manager will encourage and facilitate this, even more ideally the company you work for will pay for it. If they don’t, be prepared to spend your time and money continuing to learn.
New technologies and frameworks come up all the time, you need to be able to learn and use new things. This will take time away from your family, your hobbies, etc.
Most of the bad things I just described can be traced back to 1 thing: bad management. After working in 6 different companies in the last 13 years, I have come across bad management every single time. Every single time I tried to be positive instead of giving up, showing them the problems they were creating AND how to fix them (there’s no point in complaining if you don’t offer a solution) and every single time I was shot down. I don’t always have the correct answer, but I do know when I’m right, especially when other people validate my thoughts.
I’m going through the same problem at this very moment. Upper management is creating a lot of problems, I keep presenting solutions and they keep shutting me down. I love my team, and I really like the product, but management is producing a toxic culture that I can’t stand so I’m looking for another job. You need to know when to give up and move on.
How can you fix or avoid this kind of problem? Change your attitude. The next time you walk into an interview, don’t walk in with the mindset of “they’re interviewing me”. Your mindset needs to be “I’m interviewing them”, “I want to see if they’re a good fit or me and if they deserve my time and dedication”. You need to ask:

how do they come up with new features?
how they deal with change?
how they plan their work?
how do they deal with bugs?
how do they foster career development?
how do they promote from within?
how do they support your well being?
how are evaluations and promotions conducted?
how do you manage technical debt?
how do you care for your customer?

Ask to talk to the team.

Are they happy?
What do they like and don’t line about management?
What can management do to make things better?
Does management listen to you?
Does your opinion matter?

You’re in control.
Not everything is bad though, there are many positive things but positive things don’t make you think twice about doing something. Positive things are not warning signs. Have an open mind, be communicative, leave your ego at home, be willing to learn. If you find the right place and the right team, you will have more good days than bad. You will want to get up early and go to work, work more than 40 hours a week without being asked. You should enjoy your job, if there are problems try to fix them but recognize when it’s time to move on.You can say it louder, but not clearer: “everyone can code” doesn’t mean everyone should. As someone looking to get into my first tech job, I take the kind of advice @peachesmotorsports offers as literally pure gold. It’s not meant to be scary, it’s meant to inform. And pretending that companies aren’t crunching coders for time all the time is delusional.
This made me think of Jocko Willink’s “Default Aggressive” mindset: Taking action to solve a problem the instant it occurs.  You have to make things happen, they won’t happen on their own.  Leaders must attack a problem before it gets worse and demonstrate to their team that an aggressive approach to identifying and solving a problem is the default.
Thank you so much for this piece. I tend to have a “bring it on” attitude when it comes to problems, so this post wasn’t discouraging at all. If anything, it got me even more interested in getting a job in tech.A lot of this advice is great: particularly around talking to people, interviews being two-way, and constantly learning. I can definitely attest to the “scrapped” work part feeling terrible & eventually everyone moving on. But a few things here aren’t quite accurate in my experience:


""fast-paced environment"": this is true for some teams, but not all. Many teams strike a good balance with their shareholders about what’s a healthy, sustainable pace of development. I’ve particularly enjoyed my teams where we have fixed goals but also prioritize training ourselves & fixing tech debt.


constantly being asked why it’s taking so long: I’ve almost never been asked this.

…but you can’t miss the deadline for the sprint either: That’s just silly (and totally believable that some people would expect it). Of course, if a new sprint task is discovered, something is likely to get pushed back. Sounds like your product/project managers historically have been operating under some exceptionally painful restrictions.

extra hours: I have never been on a team that suggests extra hours in this way: in fact, most of my managers have encouraged taking more paid time off, both in teams with fixed holiday amounts & ‘unlimited’.



100% code coverage: I have been on exactly one project in the last ~8 years that has mandated it. Very few projects justify 100% code coverage (though I still maintain that one project was one, heh). Most teams are constantly asking devs to write more tests though, so this definitely rings a bell .

@peachesmotorsports it sounds like you’ve been in some painfully managed dev teams before, or at least some variation of them operating under unfortunately high stress & political turmoil? I’d love to know why it is you’ve had such bad experiences with shareholders.
Anyway, again, this response is all anecdotal, so take everything with a grain of salt!

ALL of this post but mostly this 
I also can’t emphasize enough the importance of having “soft skills”. It’s something that more people need to work on. (Think about any interview you’ve had w/behavioral questions, ‘Tell me about a time when you dealt with a conflict…’ etc those types of Q’s). Also, leave your ego at the door b/c ego helps no one (especially your co-workers).
Also, there is no perfect job (or perfect company) out there. (If there is, I would love to work there!). What you will find–and I speak from experience-- is that you might not always like what you’re working on, but get what you can from it. Learn all that you can.
One thing that I really liked about a previous job was the people that I worked with. They made the day better. You won’t find that too often so, if/when you do, hold onto that if you can.
That’s my .02 My team is why I’m trying so hard to fix things, I don’t want to abandon them. We’ve done a great job considering the lack of leadership but within the last few weeks, things just keep getting worse. My PO was protecting me from all of this, they drove her out. Now I have to deal with it and I fully understand why she left.Early on in my career I thought “this is how it is”, eventually I learned to identify the issues. I think my bad experiences come from managers that were promoted for the wrong reasons, mainly politics or seniority rather than merit. There’s a lot of “this is how it’s always been” rather than how can we make things better. I have lots of examples that would make your head explode.
At one point I attributed it to bad corporate cultures, so I ended up in a small family owned business. Turns out, this is just as bad with the family making arbitrary decisions based on fear rather than customer input. “This is how we’ve done it for 20 years, and it’s worked so far. Nobody likes change”. -> this is a direct quote from one of the partners.
I haven’t had great luck when looking for new jobs, I haven’t been in the position where I can pick the best one. Unfortunately, I end up with whoever gives me the offer first because I need to pay rent. My current job is not in jeopardy, so I’m being patient and trying to find a good fit.
I’ve been asked several times why I don’t have my own business. I’d love to, but as I said during the freelancer talk after analyzing the finances of what I was looking for I just can’t afford it.omg. did we work for the same company? Haha.
I worked in a similar culture at a very large corporation…it was rough. Positive change was incremental.I still talk to my old team from my last corporate job, 6 years later all the changes they’ve gone through have made things worse. While I’m not surprised, it’s also incredibly sad how some people flat out reject change and refuse to take constructive criticism. These are the same individuals that keep getting promoted to higher-level positions, thus keep making bad decisions. I legit showed this person how some simple procedure changes could save the company over $1 million dollars (supported by real examples) and he rejected the idea. I know for a fact he rejected it because the procedures haven’t changed. He could have easily claimed it as his own idea after I left, taken all the credit. Never did."
136,Curriculum,Learn From Home Club,0,53,"Hey there everyone!
I hope you guys are well and staying safe during these times.
As I have been getting into Coding since a few months now I’ve been continuously trying out what works best to learn from Home. At the moment I am testing a new curriculum that I put together by combining multiple pathways and work through each, bit by bit. I know that this means overall things will move forward a bit slower in the progress bar as I am splitting my time between each skill path. Prior to this I only focused on one, but knowing that in schools and universities the curriculum also splits into multiple subjects at the same time and also doing some research, I found that learning like this can be more effective not just in advancing in that skill, but also in overall brain capacity as you learn how to connect memories from one subject and apply similar principles in how you learn the other, etc.
With all that said, I wanted to ask you guys about this and if you have any tips, tricks and experiences in how to schedule or split up the learning process and curriculum.
Hope to hear from you guys soon and wish you all the best."
137,Coding in Healthcare,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",7,125,"Hello Coding Community!
I’m thinking about learning the skill of coding and would really appreciate any insight I can get from you all! I think this field is so interesting and hope that it could give me a specific skill that could add greatly to my current experience.
So far I’ve worked in the healthcare field for several years in operations (non-clinical). I have my master’s degree in Healthcare Administration and have always been interested in the IT side of things. My hope is that learning this skill could help put me in a unique position given my years in operations. I have worked with multiple EHR systems, but mostly Epic and I believe it is going to be main EHR for most healthcare facilities. I assume learning to code for a system like EPIC would be a great asset and what I’ve read so far there are several languages used in the system. Does anybody have experience with coding in this field and can share their insight on the job prospects?
I know you can teach yourself the skills, but I am seriously debating joining a bootcamp because I know I would work better with having the structure of it since I have a young family, hence why I would also love to be able to work remotely in the future. Does anybody have any recommendations on bootcamps that teach the skills needed for most jobs and especially ones for healthcare systems? I also want to say that I am totally open to jobs outside of healthcare, but I just assume coding in healthcare would give me the best chance to land a job. Also, I really love helping people and would like to continue to do that even if it is through coding. I also have a lot of customer service experiencing having to deal with patients, doctors, and managing support staff.
Sorry for the long post! Any feedback is much appreciated!

Jocelyn
Hi Jocelyn, welcome to the forums!
I do not have any experience in the healthcare industry…but, I wanted to be clearer on what you’re asking so perhaps people can chime in. I think you’re talking about healthcare informatics maybe?
Or, are you interested in building software or websites or maintaining/managing computer systems from the backend? Software engineering? Or, are you interested in the engineering or the data side of healthcare at say, an insurance company?
I would think a good place to start is to look at a hospital’s careers page and see what type of technology jobs are available and that would help narrow down what type of skillset they’re looking for–coding languages, etc.Hi Jocelyn,
I also have no experience in healthcare however just from a general hospital point of view there is a lot of data gathered from me anytime I go in for treatmeant so data science is a very relevent course if you were taking a course on codecadmy. Languages like python and SQL tie into this very highly. But like in any industry at all the range of jobs connected are so vast ,like @lisalisaj has said , that in reality any coding language can become relevent in helping you land a job in the healthcare industry if you have no specific area in mind.
Here is a relevant article from someone who does work in a health enviroment 2I work in healthcare, there is no specific language that stands out. I’ve mentioned in other posts that there are many ways to do something, nobody can tell you if Python or JAVA is better for healthcare or not, it all depends on the company, the team, and the application at hand. If you’re interested in working for a company like EPIC, then look at their job postings so you can gleam what stack they use.
We use Angular, TypeScript, Node, Docker, Kubernetes, SQL. I suggested we use Postgres 2 years ago but I was overruled, I’m making the case once again to drop SQL and move to Postgres. The healthcare billing software we plan to integrate with is coded entirely in JAVA.
I’ve said in other posts, as a developer you need to be flexible. You should not specialize in 1 language, you need to know about many languages because you never know what will be more useful for the project. Just because you know Javascript doesn’t mean everything can\should be done in Javascript. It takes time and experience.
The other thing to consider is the application itself and the end goal: does it need to be mobile-friendly, is it mobile exclusive, does it need to be compatible with a particular piece of hardware? The stack used depends heavily on the application, availability, reliability, and budget.
What you can do is learn about:

FHIR
SQL
NoSQL (Postgres and MONGO)
APIs
Security

Managing the data is the most important part of a healthcare application, having general API knowledge will be extremely useful. Given government regulations, being familiar with the FHIR standard is a must to ensure interoperability. And since you never know how the data will be stored, knowledge of SQL and NoSQL is also important. The rest, as I’ve said, you should be able to pick up. If you know JAVA, picking up Javascript is fairly easy.
Security is extremely important, healthcare data is very sensitive. You need to know how to prevent SQL injection attacks and many other things, any healthcare application will have to go through a security audit, and knowing how to prevent or fix issues is a must. This is not language-related, these are practices that need to be applied to the code.
You should already be familiar with HL7, if you’re not then you can learn about that as well.Thank you all for such a warm welcome. The feedback and information you all have shared have already helped me so much. I check my own company’s current job postings for these types of position and it had a lot of useful information. I am totally up for being flexible and am just so in the beginning stages I’m trying to figure out where to even start! 
I have a lot to learn still for sure. I am curious about feedback regarding specific real life projects or overall job descriptions and daily tasks to help me get a better understanding of the real life job duties.There might be some health care tech meetups in your city. Check out meetup.com 1
(they’d be virtual now though). Also maybe check on LinkedIn as I’m pretty sure there might be professional groups to join there where you can connect w/likeminded people in the field.

Do you have a website that features work that you’ve done/things you’ve built? Is that on your LinkedIn profile (or whatever job profile site you use) and your resume?
I think what’s important to potential employers is to see what prospective employees have built. I can’t say with 100% certainty that one needs a CS degree to get a job as an engineer. In my experience I’ve known and worked with many engineers and not all of them had CS degrees (undergrad or grad). In addition to soft skills, I  think what matters is what you’ve built and that you can show that you know how to think computationally.

It is an option that seems to always be over looked when I see this question come up.  Not sure if that is because they don’t really exist for programming jobs in many countries or if people just aren’t aware of them.
All I know is, if you go for a job without a degree or any commercial experience you will be against people who have commercial experience and maybe a degree, even if going for a junior position.  So you are going to have a hard time even getting an interview.  An apprenticeship the competition you’re against should be more even.I posted this a while back 4.

However, there is another one: you can run any code to pass checkpoints, so they don’t check if code is written correctly.

142,Overall wording,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,4,57,"So I’ll be honest I started this with NO coding experience and I’m about a third of the way thought the front-end design and I have to say I spend like 90% of the time just trying to figure out what the lessons are saying or what the questions are  and find myself looking at solutions for code just purely because I can’t figure out what the lesson is saying, the hint drop downs are about always useless in further explaining and just give you the answer. The walkthroughs on projects are just someone reading a question and then typing stuff out without explaining why or how anything works. then when I go to the forums everyone explains by using vocab words I HAVEN’T LEARNED YET so I either spend the day googling to figure out the forum answer or I just blindly work through things hoping they make sense eventually or reviewing over lessons and projects over and over until I figure it out myself.I understand your frustration. Since you have no prior coding experience, there’s definitely going to be a learning curve. I would highly recommend going through the beginning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses on Codecademy if you’re feeling really behind.
There is some overlap between the courses and career paths, so you might have some lessons already checked off. The courses are more focused on each language than the career path is going to be, and you probably won’t need to go all the way through on any of them before you start to feel more comfortable with the language and vocabulary. I do recommend that order (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).All this being said, you’ll still probably have to do some Googling as you work through the path. Googling is a big part of programming at any level, and part of learning to be a good programmer is learning how to Google effectively.
Don’t get discouraged! It’s all part of the learning journey.you get that I’m saying that once I figure out WHAT the lessons are saying I figure it out quickly, but I just am working at a snails pace because I’m just exhausting myself reading the bad writing within the lessons and questions over and over again.And also remember, if your ever too confused, feel free to ask the Codecademy community for help."

I’m 10 days into the 30 day challenge. I’m new to coding and I’m following the web development path.
I’m wondering, what is a good amount of material to aim to cover per day?
I’m aiming to cover about 1 topic per day which usually included a few lessons, a quiz and a project.
Is this a good pace to go at?
Thoughts?
Thanks for any advice!The magic of self-paced online courses is that, well, they are self-paced? You decide what’s a good amount of material per day! Sometimes I pick up a good book and I can’t put it down until I’ve read all of it. It could be the same with coding!
If you are worried that you are covering ground too quickly and your foundation will be shaky, I recommend you dedicate some days to work on personal projects instead. That way you know you have “absorbed it”. That’s how I like to do it. You might think “yeah but I haven’t covered enough material to do a project”. Probably not the case! Even with basic HTML and CSS you can try some really cool things.


 jherscovici:

I’m aiming to cover about 1 topic per day which usually included a few lessons, a quiz and a project.
Is this a good pace to go at?


If you’re assimilating the material, then sure.
If you’re doing a topic a day, but you’re finding that you don’t remember a thing from 1-2 days ago, then you didn’t learn anything because it didn’t stick. You may have passed the exercises, sure, but if you can’t recall the content then you’ve not learned it.
Go at a pace that’s acceptable to you, where you can recall most (not necessarily all - we all forget things or make errors!) of what you learned the previous few days. If you’re recalling everything, feel free to speed up.
Rushing through the material is an error that too many people make, and then they end up here asking questions that would be obvious had they spent more time on the content instead of rushing. Some days I do 8 hours somedays I’ve done five minutes. Right now I’m at 56 days and I’ve started to engage other resources but I use Codecademy as tracking my coding goals.The amount of time each student has to dedicate to learning may vary depending on other responsibilities like school, work, obligations, but I’d suggest logging on at least once a day to keep those streaks going and then learning as much as you can while keeping a steady pace and absorbing the information.
You don’t want to rush and then forget part of what you learned. It’s all about balance . For me personally, I try to do about 30 minutes to 1 hour per day of Codecademy learning, and then maybe 20 minutes or so practicing on my own code editor some of the things I learned or working on personal code-related projects."

146,Function return,Community,2,40,"New to Codeacademy so I do apologize if this is on the wrong part of the forum.
I think I somewhat understand the return line of code in the functions exercise but, can someone clarify it in Barney terms what exactly that does ? Return is just the end product of the finished function once it has completed it’s steps ? This is someone coming from a zero experience background in this field. Sorry if this was not exactly clear.
Thanks

New to Codeacademy so I do apologize if this is on the wrong part of the forum.


I suggest posting these type of questions in the Get-Help category actually. Maybe adding a language specific tag as well.
If you are asking what return does, when a function is run, it will produce something. The return line just returns that “something”.
def return_number_four():
  return 4
print(return_number_four())#4

def return_number_times_6(num):
  return num*6
print(return_number_times_6(4))#24

def return_list_of_numbers():
  lst=[]
  for i in range(10):
    lst.append(i)
  return lst
print(return_list_of_numbers()) 
#[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Those examples are in Python, but it is the same principle for any language.Think of a simple meat grinder. We put chuck steak (for example) in the top, add a little downward pressure with the wooden utensil for that purpose, hand crank for a few revolutions and out the spout comes ground chuck.
The argument is the steak; the function the grinding; and, the return is the ground meat.
def return_a_list_of_numbers(n):
    return list(range(n))

to cite the earlier example. We feed in a value for n, how many numbers we want in the list, range() returns a range object with that many data points, and list() converts that object to a list which is given back to the caller.
Also note that caller scope and function scope are not the same. The argument goes down into the function and the return comes back up to the caller."

I mean, it’s weird how I know most of the things that happened in Endgame but I still want to watch it, even though I know I will cry like a baby Well, now I’m sad. Off to rewatch Into the Spiderverse for the millionth time.OMG yassss
I’ve watched Into the Spider verse SO MANY TIMES (I’m not even counting anymore lol)…and my sister (and all my family, let’s be honest) is like “How on earth can you rewatch that movie again and again? You already know what’s gonna happen!!!”
Dude, it’s my favorite movie. The best movie ever. I am gonna watch it again and again until I’m old. (Let’s not think about getting old though).

Hi @armaan_barak,
I went through a similar realization last year.
Codecademy has great career paths that you could do for Front-End/Back-End Engineering or Full-Stack Engineering.  Full-Stack is both Front- and Back-end combined.
If you just want to dabble, looking into HTML, CSS and JavaScript are good ideas. There are also some mini courses that walk through building a site so you can test if you like how it all comes together.
However, those are all addressed in those career paths I mentioned above. You can find all of those on this page here: https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-developmentThat depends on what platforms your desktop application must support.
There are many languages which allow you to build windows desktop applications: c++, java, c#, possible more
then there are hybrid solutions which support multiple platforms (windows and mac, and maybe linux): electron, react native and more. These JS frameworks might reduce development time, but are generally worse in performance.Though not my favorite language to work with, Python is also a language that can be used for desktop applications. There are several good GUI’s for it, such as Tkinter, which comes preinstalled on several distributions.
If you have already been doing data science than you most likely already have some knowledge of Python syntax.Thanks for the suggestions @chelsead23, I’ll surely give some time exploring them.@stetim94 thanks for your suggestions. You’ve given me a variety of choices to spend time with.
I would like to try building windows applications first!
Thanks again.


 8-bit-gaming:

There are several good GUI’s for it, such as Tkinter, which comes preinstalled on several distributions.


on what distributions? Linux? Last time i used Tkinter the GUI looked like it was made late 90’s earlier 2000.@8-bit-gaming, tbh I know python  and have learnt two GUI’s Tkinter and PyQt, but they’ll need some more time to build a installer which could install the correct versions of modules and python, which would really be a hard-time. That’s why I don’t think python would be a good choice for that.
But really, I appreciate your suggestion.Ya, lol. Tkinter seems so absurd to me.If you want build windows apps, I’d recommend C# and XAML. Microsoft Visual Studio (different than VS Code) could be a helpful development tool.QT is a good library choice, but then i would go for c++ Qt. or C# and XAML is also a very viable optionThanks again @stetim94. It’s really good to have choices beforehand, coz I don’t know how it’s really going to be like.


 stetim94:

on what distributions?


At least as of Python 3.8 Tkinter still comes with the Python installer.
I only wanted to open more options, personally I would prefer a C++ GUI like Qt.Ya C++ GUI like Qt would be a considerable choice."

Thank you Codecademy. <3Thanks a lot bud I’m doing great at the moment and until now the projects and quizzes are really nice and i feel I’m using my hands way more than all the courses i tried before <3"
150,Does a cs degree help with web development?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",9,262,"Does a cs degree help with web development? Is it a good investment?Welcome to the forums!
The question is kind of open-ended.


Degrees can vary wildly in costs


CS degrees cover a lot of different ground (a lot not related to web-dev). This can either be a good thing or not depending on what your goals are.


Online learning currently changes the paradigm a bit. One of the strengths of degrees is not just the paper and the training, but the network that comes with it. I wonder how that’s affected if this social-distancing is prolonged for more than a year.


Different CS departments work on different curriculum, you’d have to find one that is known for their web-dev if that’s a very specific angle you’re aiming for. I don’t see assembly language, C++, and calculus being necessarily relevant to common web-dev (but again, it depends on what you have in mind overall).


It’s not unheard of for people to get work without degrees, particularly in web-dev.

From my past experience, the tech dept. I worked in not everyone had a CS degree. I think only a few people had MS in CS. Others, who didn’t have a background in tech learned online in a bootcamp or in an in-person classes (or, on the job) and got promoted that way. One woman I worked with had a degree in English and was the head of her dept.
So…no, IMO a CS degree isn’t a requirement to work in web dev.

Good point. I think though even if you learn online you can create communities and networks from there as well.What do you think about what this source says that 77% of web developers have a degree?

This is my course overview for my degree. And tuition is $35,000 for four years at SNHU. Which if any of these courses would be highly valuable for web development. Isnt back end to do with data and algorithms?

 dev6112515278:

What do you think about what this source says that 77% of web developers have a degree?


You’re seeing the statement “X% of people doing [job] have a degree” and are inferring from it, not necessarily correctly, that “A degree is necessary to do [job]”.
Whilst I can’t speak for other countries, in the UK there is - and has been for many years now - a great push to drive young adults leaving compulsory education into pursuing undergraduate degree courses.
As more and more people go into HE, more and more people will graduate and so more and more of the working population will hold degrees. Does this mean that you need a degree to do those jobs? Not necessarily; all we can say for certain is that we have a lot of well educated people in the workforce. 
A CS degree would likely not harm your employability as a web developer, and would more than likely give you a a firm grounding in the skills and techniques that you need to succeed in that field. Whether it’s an absolute necessity, though, is a wholly different question - and I know plenty of excellent developers who aren’t graduates.No, a computer science degree is not a good lead in to web development.
Computer Science programs are largely still about Theory, Algorithms, Math, Hardware (as it was in the 80s), and a tiny bit of coding.  Look at many undergrad CS programs and you’ll see that many are 20 years behind the curve.
The reality is that modern web development doesn’t revolve around much of that curriculum. Core skills today:

Kanban
Web Design
UX Design
Functional Porgramming Techniques
Asynchronous Programming
HTML + CSS + JavaScript
CSS FlexBox
Bootstrap
NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j)
Node.js
Express.js
React.js
Artificial Intelligence (Natural Language Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, etc)

I have yet to see a CS program that goes in-depth enough about those topics, to really merit the time and expense.  You are much more likely to find a trade/tech school (or community college) that teaches those things, than a 4-year undergrad CS program."

153,Updating Python related course material,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,5,66,"Some python courses are based on python 2. This isn’t a big problem but when you take python’s skill paths or the Data science course, topics from these courses get included, it becomes a headache to work between them without learning python 2.
Python 2 is not that useful now because everyone is shifting towards python 3. Also, Python has already received it’s 3.9 update.
Due to these reasons, I suggest that the learning material for python related courses or skill paths should be updated to use python 3.Hi,
I think all the python 2 material is the free material to study. The CC pro stuff is all Python 3.No.
Several Courses like Learn Data Analysis with Pandas, Learn Statistics with NumPy, etc. are all python 2 and come under Pro Courses. Also the lessons in these courses are there in Data Science Pro Path, Analyze Data with Python, Visualize data with Python Skill Path are ALSO PRO PATHS.Hello! Could you provide a link to these courses?It is fair to say that many sections of the paths available only on PRO still run scripts with Python2 (a lot of the data work with numpy, pandas and matplotlib still do)-
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-science/tracks/dscp-data-manipulation-with-pandas/modules/dscp-hands-on-with-pandas/lessons/pandas-i/exercises/inspect-dataframe
Most of the time it’s barely noticeable. A few things are missing or different but I’m not sure it’s a huge issue. If there are specific lessons where it causes significant issues then it might be worth pointing them out.It wasn’t a big problem but when I started this project 1, it did become a pain as I didn’t know that in python 2 we had to convert number to float to get a decimal number where quotient would be 0. I have just started the next section, which is on pandas (Course Link) and right now can’t say what is coming next.
P.S. with different versions of python the syntax used in libraries is also different. Where in python 3 we can use or and and inside function calls.
For eg,
import codecademylib
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame([
  ['January', 100, 100, 23, 100],
  ['February', 51, 45, 145, 45],
  ['March', 81, 96, 65, 96],
  ['April', 80, 80, 54, 180],
  ['May', 51, 54, 54, 154],
  ['June', 112, 109, 79, 129]],
  columns=['month', 'clinic_east',
           'clinic_north', 'clinic_south',
           'clinic_west'])

march_april = df[(df.month == 'March') | (df.month == 'April')]

print(march_april)

Here in the second last line, inside the getter attribute of df we use | only for python 2, (& also available). Whereas, in python 3 we can use or and and. This is not only the case with pandas but also with matplotlib and numpy"

Not quite ready to deal with the hassle of configuring everything on your own device? Not to worry, we’ve got a resource for you too. Repl.it 119 is an online tool that can be used to spin up a development environment with the click of a button. Follow the steps below to quickly get set-up on this site.


Create an account on the Repl.it site 119 (or log in if you already have one).


Once you’ve logged in, you’ll have the option to complete a quick tutorial of the application (highly recommended) or to start coding now. If you select the latter - you will be presented with a list available environments, from which you can select the one specified by your project prompt (ex. Python) to get started.
Note: If you navigate away  - not to worry! Use the top right-hand navigation bar & click on the my repls tab at any time, then use the red plus sign in the bottom right-hand corner to create a new environment.


Once you select the environment you need, Repl.it will generate you a pre-configured web-based environment. If you want to rename the project - click on the pen icon in the top left-hand side of the page.


On the left-hand panel, Repl.it will also allow you to create additional files & directories for your project if you need them by clicking the file & folder icons with green plus signs.


To add additional packages to the environment, you can click on the cube icon on the left-hand panel, and a search bar will appear, which allows you to search for and add packages - examples might include Jquery or Bootstrap.


You can also set up Repl to be able to code collaboratively in the same editor so that you can code live with someone else just as you may do on a Google Doc.  See here 12 for more info.

158,Add placement exams for certain courses?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,1,70,"I’ve been working on the “build chatbots with python” course, and since I already have a good foundation in python, I’ve foung this course extremely tedious since it covers a huge amount of very basic python elements over the course of many pages and exercises.
At the moment I’m here:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-chatbots-with-python/tracks/python-3-data-structures-and-loops/modules/learn-python3-lists/lessons/use-python-list/exercises/list-len 1
It would be very nice on courses like these if it were possible to jump ahead to the juicy stuff so to speak (i.e. some kind of advanced placement option). I’m getting burned out on this course just re-treading stuff I already know.
CheersHey @scott_j! Thanks for the suggestion, this is a good one. I’ll pass this along to the Product and Curriculum team so that they can consider implementing something like this in the future. I’ll keep you updated here "
159,More c++ content,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,48,"While there is c# i would like more advanced c++ content. so far the basic c++ course is a lot of fun and i want more. i know other sites have that but since you decided to add a c++ course i think more content should be added.
As a general suggestion i would say all courses should have a basic/beginner level intermediate and then advanced.I can second you @designcoder97466 . More in depth C++ and perhaps C content is something I would love to see in the future.Yes, I would love it if there’s more in depth C++ and a course on C."
160,More Game Dev,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,4,77,"I would like to see more options for learning game development on Codecademy. As of now, there’s really only the Phaser.js stuff, which is fun, but I would like to see something more relevant to non-browser based game dev.
I think there is real potential for an amazing Game Development Career Path, or maybe a C# and Unity skill path. Maybe even something about developing mods.
Anyone else agree or have other ideas?I agree with you. But I think that might not be possible because Unity is a paid platform and probably it cannot be used like anything else we do on codecademy (learning, coding in the editor in the middle and output on the right side). How could unity be integrated in a browser to be used by us?
Also languages have modules to present a GUI application to make and play games. How would a gui be opened on our screen from the terminal at the codecademy site.
I fear that a course or skill path with terminal based games is the only possible thing that can be added to codecademy.C++ and unreal engine as well. browser stuff is kind of kids games its the lowest common denominator make more higher quality stuff.The way I imagine it, most of the on-platform things would be in relation to scripting, and how to actually write the code involved, whereas the projects would primarily be off-platform. In these off-platform courses, Codecademy could provide art assets like how they do in the Phaser.js projects, or how they provide images for the off-platform web dev projects.
If Codecademy couldn’t make a Unity or Unreal skill path or course work because of licensing, Godot is a free and open source game engine, which may be a good alternative!Yes, Godot would be a good alternative. But showing the GUI window as the output in lessons would be really hard task. That was all my point there."
161,Data Science vs. Data Analyst,Community,1,347,"I’m a senior in college currently working on the Data Science learning path. After college I’m looking to become a Data Analyst to start off my career, I was wondering if all the topics covered in this path will be useful to helping me reach my goal by finding a job in this career field. I understand data scientist are more advanced than a data analyst, and I don’t want to spend my time learning something that will not be useful in helping me in my career.Hi Kevin, I’m not a professional Data Scientist, but I’m also interested in completing the Data Science here on codecademy. I worked as a market research analyst (qualitative and quantitative) for a number of years and have recently started getting into the “data science” side. I think that Data Science by itself is kind of a buzz word, but as far as I can tell, pretty much everything that is covered from a technical learning standpoint (coding, working with data in python or R, interacting with databases, visualizing data, etc, machine learning, etc) – ALL of that is directly applicable and helpful to being an Analyst. Having read various industry forums about Data Science (such as on Reddit), there is a lot of difference between what DS means in one company vs. another, and on the high end of the ability/pay scale the people that work as Data Scientists can be responsible for setting up entire networks and data flows, requiring very sofisticated computing skills as well as a strong background in statistics. Most people in the field say that going deep into statistics is more valuable than any of the other trend words associated with Data Science. However, to go back to your question, having looked over the course list here in the DS area, I think that all of it would benefit you (and me) moving forward. Somethings might be beyond what you need to start out as an analyst (i.e. Node.js, front-end programming) but those are solid areas to learn about when you get there. Hope that helps. One other thing, keep in mind that even when you’re working as an Analyst, you’re job is solving business problems and human problems. No one gets hired just to analyze something, they get hired to solve problems and improve the company’s situation. Everything you can learn here will give you a better toolset to solve problems, regardless of the job title or buzzwords."

163,Should I take up a statistics course before starting the data science career path?,Tips and Resources,2,60,"Hey guys, I completed the python 3 course and would like to start the data science career path. I have less knowledge of statistics. And data science requires a lot of statistics knowledge. So should I take up a course on statistics before starting the career path? Drop in your advice. Thank you.Hi, @object6296178624. You’re right, data science does require a good amount of statistics knowledge. @webdevholland recently posted about having to refresh her statistics skills while taking the Data Scientist Path in this post: I have to relearn statistics :/ 6. She linked a good article about statistics that you may find helpful! Also, I know @lisalisaj has nearly completed the Data Scientist Path. She might have some great insight for you! Hi @object6296178624 – Congrats on completing the Python 3 course & your new foray into data science!
I don’t think you need to take a pre-course in stats. I think you can learn simultaneously. For me, it’d been awhile since I’d studied stats (grad school) but once I started going through the DS modules, it started to come back to me (I also take a bunch of notes when I’m learning). Plus, I think that there’s so many helpful online resources for stats that can supplement your learning journey in DS.  I would suggest not rushing through the material too. A common theme here that I see others repeat is, ‘it’s a marathon, not a sprint.’ "
164,Get a Job Purely Through Codeacacdemy?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,118,"Hi,
Like the millions of other people on this Earth, I’ve decided to pursue getting a job in the field of software development. I also know absolutely nothing about computers/code in general except for what I’ve learned here. Now, I am taking the Code Foundations career path but after that, will the other career paths and skill paths only in CodeAcademy be enough to help me in the job market, or should I supplement with other resources to accomplish that?CC is a great tool but as with any tool I would look to have a wide array of sources.

166,Career Paths: layout suggestion,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,65,"Hiya Fellow Coders
I have a small suggestion for the Codecademy designers to consider. In the Career Paths [or in any other course for that matter] the list of lessons is currently following the old-style forum-threads-like layout: top to the bottom list of topics with hidden subelements that reveal upon clicking. It is very easy to follow, and I quite like it, however, if you are on a longer path/course page, the list is getting quite extensive. For instance, on FED it’s 26 steps, and on Full-Stacj something around 40+. If you are to get back to some of the previous topics [to read through them, or redo them - which I tend to do to refresh my mind] you have to scroll through several lines, and it takes quite a long time to jump back to the area you are looking for.
My suggestion would be twofold: either implement some sort of navigation tool [search/scrolling list on side or on the bottom?] or allow the topics to hide/reveal upon user action in the same way that the subtopic contents are. Example: right now the FED topic ‘15. Web Apps’ is having three subelements: Intro, What is Web Apps? and Review. They are all having between one and three subelements to follow. My idea is that all three would be visible after clicking/revealing the topic content, and their own content would be available after yet another click.
I feel like it would simplify navigating through the content.
Anyway, I absolutely love the platform. It’s a real game-changer!
Best,
K.Agreed with this suggestion, especially the second one!I really like this suggestion,  especially a search bar, scrolling through all those topics are a pain."
167,Next.js course is a must at this time,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,69,"Hi!
My suggestion is to add a course focused on next.js, the platform is having a huge boom and is extremely relevant for those using React.
What do you think, will be a good challenge?noob question: what is the relevance of next.js aside from the observation that there is a boom?Many interesting things that the next allows, such as Server Side Rendering, image optimization, internationalization of routing, and much more.
I am not an expert, and maybe someone with more knowledge can let you know more detailed information about the nextjs features. Still, only the part of static pages that is fundamental to SEO is already quite relevant.Agreed, I would really like another JS course too."
168,VSCode formatting on save for React,Tips and Resources,3,50,"Hi!
Does anyone know how to automatically format our code in VSCode in React?
I’m using ESlint but nothing happened on save.You can usually find an option in the settings that allows you to format on save with a particular linter.  If not, the page for that VS Code extension may tell you something to specifically add to the settings.json to enable it.  If all else fails, I’m sure a Google search will pull something up.  Just search “ESlint format on save”Go to settings(ctrl + ,) and search for “format”.  The third option should be your solution.Its on, to format on save, but does not seem to be working, got to check the ESlint conf."

173,Putting your Coding knowledge into Words,Corner Bar,6,101,"Hi there 
Does any of you ever struggle with explaining the coding concepts you learned? Like, with your own words? Without just reading from the lesson. For me it’s something hard tbh, and really, if you can’t put what you think you know into words, then that knowledge isn’t as solid yet.
I would love it if you had some tips for putting coding knowledge into words…so far the only thing I’ve figured out that has really helped me, is to not be afraid to “sound dumb”. And don’t say words you don’t know the meaning of just because they were in the lesson. So every time I go like “The self keyword refers to the instance, not to the class”, I would ask myself “Yeah and what’s an instance?”. You know, like, pretending you’re having a conversation with someone who knows nothing about coding. That helps me discover if I actually know the things I just assumed I knew because “who wouldn’t know that?”.
Sometimes I’m afraid to ask myself those questions, because I know that I don’t really know the answers, and I don’t wanna feel dumb. So I end up with a non-solid knowledge…but hey! I didn’t feel dumb!  
Please excuse my redundant rambling 
(Its not as long as I thought though)I find using real-world examples and metaphors helps when explaining concepts that are difficult to grasp in the abstract.  Often, the concepts are more difficult because you are trying to think of them in the abstract.
If you can find a way to relate the concept to something more familiar and tangible, you will feel more confident in your knowledge, and you won’t be met with a blank stare when you describe it to someone else.Thanks a bunch for your advice. I will put it into practice This! I had to explain how the * operator unpacks lists to my little sister.
I used the example:
you have a truck full of packages, and you want to unpack them. You would go one by one unloading the truck (you use * for iterators like lists). So now you have all your packages laid out not stored in the truck.
truck=['obj1','obj2','obj3']
print(*truck)
>>> obj1 obj2 obj3



 h1lo:

I had to explain how the * operator unpacks lists to my little sister.


Oh man 
I’m gonna guess she got it in the end, cause honestly that was a great example 
Luckily for me, my little sister (yep I also have a little sister XD) is learning to code with me, so it isn’t that hard to try to communicate coding ideas to her 
The only con is that I loose my patience easily when someone doesn’t understand what I’m trying to say 


 yizuhi:

The only con is that I loose my patience easily when someone doesn’t understand what I’m trying to say


Same. I try not to get angry cuz to me it’s such a simple concept and they’re not getting it.I think what you bring up is actually a very important topic for programmers, and that’s communication.
Many times we will need to verbalize programming concepts to people such as businesses and professionals.
Metaphors and careful phrasing can be important in doing this.
Instead of explaining your if, else if, else control flow in detail, you can say something like “I’ve programmed a sequence of checks to compare the input data and display the most relevant result to the user.”
Perhaps this is a topic Codecademy may introduce in the future .
I’d certainly be interested in learning more about this. "
174,Coding Journey,Random,1,75,"Since beginning coding again after my initial run at the community college with a few CS classes under my belt. Codecademy has really helped me stay on track helping me focus on what I really want to do with coding. I feel like the structure really helps me when I’m learning all new concepts, and how to correctly apply them relative to the specific programming language. After seven months I’m pretty excited about having the confidence to access learning tools and the vast amount of resources online. I just got a job doing e-commerce at a grocery store in town so it has been really interesting checking out what kind of computer programs and software they are using when receiving orders online! I’m thinking about a python program I can write helping me at work since the data they are using is incorrect sometimes.That’s wonderful to hear that Codecademy is helping you stay on track!

Did you set a personal goal and achieve it and set another goal?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins!  I finished some newly added python projects, looped back through loops (ha, ha) and continued with my coding streak. Day 139, yea!
Non-coding related: my parents love the scarves that I crocheted for them and I’m about to go make some baked apple crisp because I have 4lbs of Honeycrisp apples.      This is going to sound really lame, but…
Once again coding related! Since replacing the terrible Bootstrap-based holding page on my domain (and enjoying my much quieter inbox, with security notifications being few and far between for my own code) I’ve continued tinkering with the page.
Managed, with a bit of wrangling, to get some Bootstrap-like bits and pieces working from a “first principles” approach… so I’ve finally got some working modals going. Not a huge achievement, but I’m quite happy I’ve not yet had to resort to a framework for the page (and if I did, it wouldn’t be Bootstrap!).Coding related: I got a friend that just finished a bootcamp and she’s willing to share the roadmap and some of the better bits of the experience with me! (for free yay) So I’m excited to keep adding things to my toolbox.
Not coding related: I pre-ordered Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and I’m REALLY excited for it. I tried the demo yesterday and it’s going to be awesomeCoding Related: Finished the old Science Path capstone project which I had been postponing, but I still want to work with the available data.
Not: My biggest 3D Modeling project yet got some awesome responses. Really excited about it all. Made some awesome vegan cookies, really chocolaty and chewy. Received some awesome clips from friends of my mom for her 60th birthday video and have been editing it, had to pat myself.Coding related: Got a shoutout in the Codecademy community newsletter. Was not expecting that, and it felt nice!
Not coding related: My friend who recently got into Twitch streaming asked me to design an overlay for him, and he loved it!My win this week was staying on target with my 30 day goal through Codecademy to login at least once a day to complete at least one lesson. Since signing up for the Pro membership 4 days ago, I’ve logged on each of these 4 days with no plans of stopping.
Even with a lot happening in the world right now, I’ve made my learning journey my top priority as I work to gain new skills and self-improve. . Currently working on the skill track to create web applications with Python with plans soon after to begin the Data Science career path. "

As long as you have at least 8GB of RAM and an internet connection you should be fine.  You don’t really need much computing power to write code, especially as a beginner.  Plus, once you get to more intensive computations (like Machine Learning if you go that route) there are options for running your code in the cloud.
Since you are starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you are mostly going to be running those in the browser.  So long as you have enough RAM for your internet browser to run smoothly, that is all you really need.Right! I write my code down on paper since it helps me learn. In my limited experience, I use Ubuntu because its a lot lighter and faster than windows in my opinion, so optimizing your operating system works well also. I don’t have high powered computers yet either, but I haven’t had any performance issues writing code since I’m still a newbie anyway.Just in case anyone here is looking to revive an old computer (or use minimal resources on a newer computer), it is worth checking out Lubuntu:



lubuntu.me 3



Lubuntu | The official Lubuntu home 3





Lubuntu is a super-lightweight flavor of Ubuntu so if you’re really strapped for resources (under 8 GB of RAM or under 256GB of hard drive space), you’ll want to check it out. I’ve been considering switching my 2009 iMac over from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to Lubuntu 18.04.5 LTS to speed it up and squeeze a couple more years out of it For HTML, CSS, JS, and Python you should be absolutely fine, even on lower end hardware as these typically have pretty low requirements to render properly and quickly. Some people have even used low end computers such as the Raspberry Pi which is about $29 to learn how to code with success.
As most Codecademy courses happen on-site, you should be fine as long as you have access to an internet browser. "

I learned some things about functions, which are just bigger variables, but BIGGER () And thats about it.Ready, Set, Here I GO! Going to have a working understanding machine learning.Hi everyone
My name is Ayaan and i started the 30 day challengeAwesome! Good luck @ayaan753luckThanks @irlfede
I appreciate it"
178,Trying to figure out Keydowns,Random,4,83,"So I’ve been trying to figure out how to assign the keyboard events of the numerical keys to emojis for this challenge. Not sure how to go about it.
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
Here's the numbers' corresponding emojis:

5 = :grin:
3 = :slight_smile:
3 = :neutral_face:
2 = :frowning2:
1 = :face_with_symbols_over_mouth:

```event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex

*/

const box = document.getElementById(""box"")
const text = document.getElementById(""text"")

box.addEventListener(""focus"", function(){
    text.textContent = ""Type a number between 1 and 5""
})

box.addEventListener(""focusout"", function(){
    text.textContent = ""Click here to give your rating""
})not sure if this is your typo or the prompts, but two of those number/emoji pairs say 3.
as for the question, you’ll need to use the keydown event listener and use the key codes for the number keys in question. you’ll need to check which key is being pressed and output the correct emoji depending on that key (i would use a switch statement).
it might look something like this:
box.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
    switch(event) {
        case (event.keyCode === 49): //keyCode for 1
            return ':grin:';
            break;
        ...
    }
});

search “keydown value javascript” on google to find what key codes you need. good luck!Also note that as long a key is held, it will be repeatedly triggering the handler. Better to use keyup so there is no possibility of repetition.When we can utilize a switch, there is a good chance we can utilize a dictionary that uses less logic. A simple .get() will suffice.
emojis = {
  1: ':face_with_symbols_over_mouth:',
  2: ':frowning:',
  3: ':neutral_face:',
  4: ':slight_smile:',
  5: ':grin:'
}

document.onkeyup = event => emojis.get(event.key, false);

Correction, wrong language. Let’s tweak the above to be JS.
document.onkeyup = event => {
  if (emojis.hasOwnProperty(event.key) {
    return emojis[event.key]
  }
  return false
}
Test case
Object.prototype.get = function (key) {
  if (this.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    return this[key]
  }
  return false
}

const print = function (arg) {
  console.log(arg)
}

const emojis = {
  1: ':face_with_symbols_over_mouth:',
  2: ':frowning:',
  3: ':neutral_face:',
  4: ':slight_smile:',
  5: ':grin:'
}

print (emojis.get(1))

:face_with_symbols_over_mouth:

Worked once, and never again, at least not in the sandbox. Needs more exploration. Perhaps a class for us to attach a get method to?

Down the rabbit hole…
class Emojis {
  constructor (keys) {
    this._keys = keys
  }
  get keys () {
    return this._keys
  }
}
Emojis.prototype.get = function (key) {
  if (this.keys.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    return this.keys[key]
  }
  return false
}
const emojis = new Emojis({
  1: ':face_with_symbols_over_mouth:',
  2: ':frowning:',
  3: ':neutral_face:',
  4: ':slight_smile:',
  5: ':grin:'
})

print (emojis.keys[1])
print (emojis.get(1))

:face_with_symbols_over_mouth:
:face_with_symbols_over_mouth:

print (emojis.keys[6] || false)
print (emojis.get(6))

false
false

This is by no means production code. It is not rigorously tested, and just an exploration. The wrinkles would need to be ironed out of these ideas."

181,Why isn’t there .LISP on Codecademy?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,99,"Hello everyone ,
I wanted to generally ask why .lisp isn’t part of the selections to learn Codecademy? Is it due to the low popularity of it or everyone stuck on Python? I also have another programming language I wanted to try which is called Julia which is made by MIT and I waned to know why this isn’t part of Codecademy also?Almost certainly due to low popularity.  It takes a lot of time to develop a course, and if they develop one in a language that few people use, it won’t be a cost effective way to spend their time.
As you can see, Lisp didn’t even make it on to this ranking 2, and Julia (albeit an awesome language) is barely gaining popularity.  In another 5 years, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a Julia course on Codecademy.  However, Lisp has been around since the 1950s and doesn’t look to be gaining popularity in the coming years.yeah I would agree, Lisp has the reputation of being antiquated and there is probably a poor cost-benefit ratio for the developers of codecademy course content."

183,Before you start looking for a job,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",17,2.4k,"I’ve seen a lot of questions here about how to go about finding a job after completing a course, I wanted to share some thoughts based on my experience.
Why am I writing this? Because:

I’ve been where you’ve been, and I wish I knew this several years ago
I interview people and decide if they join my team (I’m a Software Engineering Manager), so this is what I look for in candidates

Let’s get the most common question out of the way. Can I get a job after completing a Codecademy course? The answer is very simple. No, you can’t. Why?

You don’t have enough experience
There are a lot of other things you need to learn that the course most likely doesn’t cover

You can get an internship, and maybe you’ll get paid a little. If you’re very very lucky, you might be able to get an entry-level job but the biggest factor is that the company has to be willing to teach you, groom you into a decent developer. Not a lot of companies are willing to do that because it’s expensive and it takes time. In case you didn’t know this already, all companies are under tight deadlines. All the time. So if they hire someone, they need that person to be productive immediately otherise they’re losing money. Nobody likes to lose money, so you need to be productive from day 1.
Bottom line, don’t count on finding a job after completing a course. So what do you do? You need experience with the following:

Installing software

Yup, you need to know how to install software. Sounds dumb? Maybe, but how many of you know that after installing a specific piece of software you need to update your PATH before you can use it?? Exactly. Do you want examples of that? Install Python or the latest JDK (If you took the Python course, you might already know this. If you didn’t, surprise!). Why do I bring this up? Because I just went through this with a new hire last week. She told me she couldn’t get the app to run, after troubleshooting her laptop turns out she didn’t update the PATH. Updated the PATH, problem solved. Do I want to deal with this as your supervisor? Absolutely not, I expect you to know these things.
While we’re at it, keep your OS up to date. The last thing I want a new hire to do is spend a whole day updating their OS so they’re able to install the latest version of something.

Command line or Terminal

You need to be proficient, if not master the command line or terminal. A lot of what you’ll be doing will happen here.

navigation
file management
permission management
software\package management
resource management


Software dependencies

I provide all new employees with a step by step guide of what they need to install to run the project. Most companies don’t do that, so if they want you to pull the repo and run the project, you need to know what your dependencies are.
No, this does not mean that you have to memorize things or take notes, but you have to be able to figure it out. You can’t run an Express API without Node, and you can’t start a container without Docker. Most of the time error messages are very descriptive, other times you have to google it and use a solution someone else has found. You need to be resourceful as you’ll be spending a bit of time trying to figure out why something doesn’t work.

Version control

You need to know how to use git, how to manage branches, and adapt to different environments. The courses are very useful and simple for beginners but after that, you need to move on quickly. Whether you’re working at a company or working on your own, you need to know how to use git and have a good branch strategy. You also need to be able to manage different environments: dev, test, stage, load, prod. What code goes where, how to identify what version is in what environment. Create a hotfix branch and deploy to prod.

CSS

You need to know how to make things look pretty (unless you’re a backend developer), this includes:

adjusting colors
alignment for text, elements, pictures
responsive design
animations
working with third-party libraries
use master CSS classes (makes the code more efficient)


Professional development

During an interview, I always ask what they do to stay up to date. As I’ve said in several posts, you never stop learning so what are you actively doing to stay up to date? Listening to podcasts? Which ones? Follow blogs? Which ones? RSS feeds? Which ones? Webinars, conferences, more courses?
If you’re not actively expanding your knowledge, it’s a red flag for me. And don’t just blurt out something just to provide an answer, be honest.

Docker

Learn how to use Docker, it’s popular because it’s extremely useful. Don’t know what it is? Go find out. I’m not giving you any links on purpose because you need to be resourceful.
More than anything you need experience writing code. How do you get experience?

Join a local meetup, put yourself out there. Most likely you won’t get paid, but what you need is to write code.
Reach out to non-profits and offer your services for free. Non-profits are more likely to take on a beginner provided they don’t have to pay. You’ll gain experience, and it’ll look good on your resume.
Most likely there is a site out there that has projects you can do or join. Can’t find one? Then make one! Do yourself a favor and make a site that provides projects for people to learn, it’s a good way to network.
Get a Raspberry Pi. These units are very cheap, there are a lot of cool projects out there that you can replicate or just use your imagination and come up with your own. Add them to the site you created in the previous point while you’re at it.
Don’t have a lot of imagination? Find Project Euler, that’ll keep you busy for a while.
This comic has been used for lots of things, applies here as well. Now stop reading this and go write some code.
practice1080×1080 97.1 KBThanks for this! This should be stickied or something for people to come back to.Thanks so much for the info! What about WordPress and things like Wix. Where do these things fit into the web dev world?
ThanksMy WordPress knowledge is limited, I used it for a personal blog that no longer exists as I didn’t want to keep paying for the domain and hosting.
In the dev world, it is a useful skill for freelancers. In a corporate setting (where you’re an employee) you’re not going to see it unless it’s a very small company or a non-profit. Why? Because it’s a cookie-cutter website builder as most of the building is a drag and drop exercise. The knowledge required is way less than someone who writes code. It is a lower cost, which means that the developer in charge of a WordPress site can’t be expected to have the same salary as a coding developer.
I don’t mean that as a bad thing, it’s just meant for people who know the basics but don’t really write code. It servers a very specific purpose. WordPress gives you templates for basic things like a personal blog or a small store, so your customer can be a bed and breakfast who wants an online presence or someone who builds crafts and wants to sell them (there are lots of other templates).
You also have a lot of plugins available, some are free and some are not. So if the bed and breakfast needs a calendar for guests to book their stay, most likely there’s a plugin for that. Install it, configure it, and you’re done. From the productivity perspective, it is simpler than coding it.
Pro #1: Your CSS knowledge needs to be very basic. All the templates are pre-built, you just need to pick one your customer likes.
Drawback #1: The templates are pre-built so you have limited access to color schemes. They are also limited, so as a freelancer you need to do some research to see who else is using that template. Are they a competitor of your customer? Do they sell something offensive to your customer? Can they be mistaken for your customer thus causing negative publicity?
Pro #2: Lots of plugins available. As I mentioned earlier, they provide lots of functionality.
Drawback #2: The plugins are continually getting updates, if you don’t keep everything up to date some of the functionality might break. As an example, I had a plugin that connected my Instagram account to the site, that plugin kept breaking and I had to reset the token to be able to see the posts on the main page.
Pro #3: Write your own plugin, potentially make some money out of it (this requires coding though…).
Drawback #3: The company or individual who made the plugin decided to stop supporting it, or delete it altogether. Now you have to find another one.
Drawback #4: You don’t have control over the code, so while you can install a lot of plugins for different things that you might need, you can’t customize it. If the bed and breakfast becomes so popular that it was purchased by the Hilton and now your WordPress website needs to connect to the Hilton’s website, then you need a custom API. I don’t know if that’s possible with WordPress, again my experience is limited.
That is why it’s more relevant for freelancers, you need to have a very good knowledge of what it can and it can’t do to determine how useful it can be for a specific client.
On the other hand, if you are a freelancer and your customer has an idea for the next ebay, or the next Amazon, be sure that you won’t be able to build that with WordPress. You need to code that, from scratch. There are plenty of frameworks and libraries that can help you, but you still need to build everything yourself.
Regarding freelancing, I gave a couple of presentations. The recording for the first one is here 17, waiting for @alissavigil to post the second one.
Regarding the backend, to my knowledge (I can be wrong) it’s very limited. If you need to build an API, I don’t think you can do it with WordPress. If you need to integrate with an API, not sure if it’s possible.Ok thank you so much for the in depth response. It’s very handy to have advice come from professionals, nothing can replace it.
I will most definitely look into your presentation tomorrow as I am done working for today. That sounds like a great resource
Ya my main goal for now is to become a freelancer. So maybe this will be covered in your presentation, but if not, I was wondering do you even need to know to code for freelancing, because as it sounds, wordpress is more common for small businesses and freelance situations. Unless you are freelancing for a big company maybe.
Second I was even thinking working remotely is better then working as a freelancer because you get benefits and can work remotely. In the future a goal of mine might be working remotely for an American company while living in Europe but I don’t know if that’s possible.
Also ever since starting down this path there’s always been that topic of college vs no college. I am 20 with one year of college done. I am majoring in computer science. Is their a usefulness of a college degree in the web dev field? Let’s say I want to pivot into software dev at some point, maybe then it’s more useful? I have lots of smaller questions like this but don’t want to ask everything at once.
So maybe when you have time you can answer some of these questions, that would be greatly helpful and I would be very grateful.
Thanks,
AndrejDo you have to know how to code? No, but that limits the type of clients you can take on. If someone wants a mobile app to go with their site, WordPress won’t let you do that. Also, big companies don’t hire freelancers, your clients will be limited to individuals or small companies. That means that the income you may receive is smaller because they will have smaller budgets. Can you make a living out of that? As I said in the presentation, if you want to be a freelancer coding is important but it’s the least of your problems.
Not a lot of American companies allow you to work outside the US, for security reasons. Even if you are American.
College is useful, but usually not for the reason people think of. I currently don’t use any of the things I learned in college, but it helped me develop an inquisitive an analytical mind. It shapes you for the future, and you might learn a thing or two. Also, some companies have a degree as a requirement for jobs, if you don’t have one then they won’t look at your resume.
I don’t mean to be rude, but if you don’t understand how a Computer Science major can be useful for your future given your interests, goals, and ambitions then you need to talk to the school counselor. You don’t want to spend time and money on something you don’t know how you’re going to benefit from.
If you want to be a freelancer, I suggest a double major in business and computer science. Then, you need to learn how to code. As a freelancer, you’re running a business where you’re your own boss. You need to balance assets and liabilities, develop business plans and marketing strategies, network with people and if you’re successful, hire people to work for you. It is not as easy as people think.
Is the double major required? No. Does it make your life easier? Absolutely. It minimizes mistakes while maximizing your budget and your strengths. It sets you up for success.Ok thank you so much for the response!
So far I have built a list of things I need to learn. It goes like this:
-Digital Marketing
-Codeacademy/FCC courses
-Look for projects on freelance sites (I am beginner-intermideate level in terms of web dev coding languages… I learned html, css, javascript, and am learning python)
-Work on my own projects
-College
-Build my website for a beat store I am making / for my personal portfolio website… would wordpress be able to make a beat website where I need people to be able to download beats and listen to them?
-Wordpress
-Learn installing software properly
-Learn command line in depth (already know basics)
-Learn about software depencies
-Version control
-Docker
-web design
My main goal is to become a freelance web developer but looking at the job postings on upwork has left me very confused as to what to actually learn. I have been thinking that I should just follow codeacademy and freecodecamp curriculum, but again, after looking at the job postings, I see lots of skills I have never heard of.
Also the issue of wordpress vs handcoding is really confusing me, as I dont see the point of being a web developer if people can make their own websites these days really easily. My uncle runs a business and his website was made by him with wordpress.
How do I learn to build a website from scratch is their any good websites or videos on this? I would not know where to start coding or how to start.
Is my list of things to learn smart for my goal of becoming a freelance developer?
Again the upwork postings have left me really confused as to what to learn. Most of the skills are not stuff I find on FCC or Codeacademy but Ill have to look deeper. Also the skills seem to change drastically from job to job, so how do you specialize in one field while freelancing.
Is it smart to get a broad base of knowledge or should you focus yourself on one skill? I feel the latter is better, but it is proving hard to do.
I have more questions but cant think of them at this time.
If you have time to answer this I would be very grateful.
Thanks,
AndrejWordPress was made for people like your uncle, he’s not a developer and was able to make a simple website he needed. Keyword simple. The templates that WordPress offers have the functionality he needs. If you want to make something like this 28, you can’t do that with WordPress, you need to write it from scratch. The APIs for overdrive are complex, and the searcing mechanism rivals that of Google. Searching their catalog efficiently is very complicated (hundreds of thousands of records by several keywords), WordPress will not be able to do such a thing. Overdrive has their own developers, I used to test that site, the library sites, the mobile apps, and the marketplace where libraries manage their collections. This is not something a freelancer would normally do, but it is something they should be able to do. I don’t have details on your project, so it’s hard to say if it can be done with WordPress.
Codecademy has a career path for web development, I haven’t explored it but it sounds like they teach you what you’re looking for. If you haven’t watched the freelancing recording, this is something you need to know: different projects have different requirements. Just because you know Javascript doesn’t mean that everything can or should be done with Javascript. As a freelancer, you have to learn many different languages and technologies. Want another resource? Go to the angular website and follow the tutorial for the tour of heroes app, that is an example of building something from scratch.
You said you know HTML and Javascript, you need to build on those skills. I said build, not master. Mastering a language is not a realistic goal. Once you have enough experience with Javascript, learn something else. The job postings will give you a guide on what is popular and what skills people are looking for. Don’t know what it is? Figure it out, Google is your friend. As I’ve said before, you need to be resourceful. Most of the problems I resolve on a daily basis come from Google searches, someone has run into the problem before. I’ve only had 1 instance where I could not find an answer and it took me a week to figure it out on my own, I did it by analyzing the problem and looking for solutions for something similar.
Don’t know what to learn first? Read this post 24.
Your ultimate goal is to have a broad base of knowledge, you just have to learn 1 thing at a time. I always get the impression that people are in a hurry, I need to know this so I can get a job. It takes time, I’ve been doing this for almost 12 years and I constantly feel that I don’t know enough. Can you take on little projects as you learn? Of course, but it will be a few years before you can be able to make a living from being a freelancer.
If you specialize in something it should be a subject like finance or digital media or transportation, you should not specialize in a language or technology because it narrows your opportunities.thanks a ton…sir. for sharing a good information.Thanks so much, my dude. I’ve been wondering about how to plan my next steps after completing the courses.Thank you for all the information!Do you think that more people get freelancing jobs after some hands on work at a real job or before getting a real job?
Some people say before and some people say you need to work somewhere before you freelance in order to gain knowledge
Thanks
…but how many of you know that after installing a specific piece of software you need to update your PATH before you can use it??

Does anyone have a link to resource which explains how to update the PATH via the command line? I don’t entirely understand when I might encounter this problem. For example, I recently installed NodeJS and I’m able to use it just fine, but I don’t recall having to update the PATH to do so.
Any input would be appreciated! I have 0 clue on how to use the command line, but on Windows, if you go to start and type in “edit the” this pops up

And if you click on it you see this

Click Environment Variables
image606×570 35.3 KB
And you see that. Go to system variables and select “Path”. Click “Edit…”

And you see this, click on “New” and paste the link to an application you have installed.
So an example would be pasting C:/Home/folder/my_app.exe.
Hit ok then hit it one more time and boom! Added to your path.



 vincanger:

I recently installed NodeJS and I’m able to use it just fine, but I don’t recall having to update the PATH to do so.

184,I have to relearn statistics ,Tips and Resources,4,854,"I felt I needed to better understand the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics after reading through this lesson 11 in the Data Scientist Career Path.  I found this online article, “Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics. What’s the difference?” 184 which did a good job of explaining the difference between the two types of statistics and provided a clear example of each.  Maybe others will find the article helpful as well.Statistics is such a complex and beautiful subject! I spent the last 2 years immersed in masters level statistics classes and I’m still constantly learning new things.
Keep an eye out for some new stats content coming early next year – we’re currently working on a bunch of lessons that teach inferential statistics through simulation based approaches (eventually slated for the hypothesis testing module)! this article on the Central Limit Theorem 25 and this one on hypothesis testing 21 might also be helpful resources This is good stuff- thanks @sophsommer3!!  Sometimes I wish I had majored in math instead of accounting when I was in college.  I took only one statistics course then & that was simply to fulfill degree requirements.  I did like that statistics course though, probably more than the other courses I took at the time.
Looking forward to the new stats content coming out… refreshing myself on the subject is something I’ve been meaning to do (have my eye on this cool online book 33)… it would be wonderful to see this topic fleshed out more in Codecademy    Oooh!

Take breaks! It’s better to do 30 minutes where you are focused every day than 3 hours of low focus. It might sound counter-intuitive to contrast the times like that, but focus both helps you grasp things better and also retain more things down the line.Thanks!

Reflection on a 35 Day Streak 30-Day Challenge


    Reflection on a 35 Day Streak  
The Beginning of the Beginner 
 Many years ago in high school I had taken a Web Design course and absolutely loved it. HTML & CSS were my jam and it was a class I always looked forward to. It never occurred to me to truly think about pursuing those skills further. I knew I liked what I was doing, but no one really talked about jobs as a developer.  
Fast forward going to college and getting both my bachelors and masters degrees I always kept the love for HTML & C…
  

I agree with toastedpitabread, notes are key for challenges like that, and also, good luck. Hey @a2422!
I’ve only just started myself but have managed to gather a few helpful bits of advice which might help you:

Take your time. It’s not a race.; the important part is that you understand what you’re learning. There’s no point going
over lots of new stuff and forgetting half of it 

Take notes and go over them every once in a while.
Have a play with what you’ve learnt.
Set a daily alarm or block out the time in your calendar every day.

As mentioned above, I’m a total noob myself so this is all the advice I can really offer you for now. 
Hope it’s helpful in some way or another!Hi @lilybird
Can you give me some tips for this 30 day challenge"

187,Errors in my code while practising,30-Day Challenge,5,246,"While I’m trying to code there are errors in my code getting disappointed and getting irritated to code again…Craftsmanship takes patience and practice.It really does get frusturating when the terminal/console returns an error when I had thought I had written the code correctly; recently, however, I have been getting better at languages’ syntax due to these initial irritations with trying to find what exactly went wrong in my code. From what I have experienced, mental irritation is definately a factor when learning almost anything (especially in areas of learning where you realize that you probably shouldn’t have spent a many-hour coding session sitting with improper posture, but I digress); but that just makes the payoff even more worthwhile once you get the hang of it.You shouldn’t let errors get you down too badly, especially not whilst you’re learning!
Even professional developers, with years of experience, do not produce code that’s 100% error free the first time out. (Want proof? Take a look at the number of patches any commercial software program gets. If it was perfect, there’d be no errors, and no patches to fix bugs or security flaws!)
Errors are part of programming; learning how to fix them is a big part of learning how to program. Ditto. There are phases in my coding practices where I have constant troubles and try to develop alternative solutions that produce the same irritating message. Try not to stress. I always find hope in the midst of suffering, which ultimately leads to better results.See there are lot of mistakes in everyone so try try and try then you would get it"

It’s super easy. Just pick a registrar and buy your domain (if it’s available). 
For example, if I were to buy anaskhan.net, I could get it from Dynadot for $5.99. 
Trustworthy registrars are Bluehost, Namecheap, GoDaddy, and I can vouch for Dynadot.

Well if you do use Unity, Unity uses C# to create games, but it supports other languages too.  C# and C++ are both similar, so if you have experience with C++, you should be able to understand C# concepts in game making within Unity, and the language is simpler.
But I’d mainly learn C++ since other game engines use it and it’s  one of the most used languages in game development. Also, Codecademy teaches the language! 

Also: Unity has lessons on their website that should help you out when beginning to use the software, so that’s nice too I’m always mixing up unity and unreal!
Can’t really go wrong I suppose!Or you can stick to HTML5 game development, so you only need to know HTML, CSS and Javascript.
(CSS and HTML to give the website a look, like on transformice 15)
Here’s a game 70 I made on the HTML canvas (move with A and D and space to shoot).
Hope this helps Thanks for the advice! Your game was great!Game Development 8 is a very big topic. You need to have knowledge of programming languages. Nowadays there are many game engines that made game development slightly easier. But still, you need to learn some programming languages
There are two main types of programming for game development that you should pay attention to- what is known as  system programming  and  web programming.
System programming

C ++
C#
JAVA
PYTHON
LUA
SWIFT

Web-based game development

HTML
CSS

Yet, when we gaze at it in full view, that halo is not there. It’s just a bright disc.
Just the same, we’re seeing the full moon on this calendar date for the first time in 76 years. It’s like Halley’s Comet, but slightly more local. Not like we won’t see a full moon for seventy six years, just not on this date. Totally didn’t think about this, ever. Won’t be here when it happens again, that’s sure.

This just in, it’s also a Blue Moon. How’d we miss that?Ah! I wish I could have seen it. I got to see it on the horizon last night, it was indeed a beautiful sight with its orange glow.

no, but with the my courses button you should see all the courses you have access toHi! actually I’m trying to learn web development via code academy but it force me to join as a pro member. the fact is my country has been Sanctioned by America, so unfair!!!
so maybe 20$ is not a great amount for Americans but it is for us!!!
and it comes to lots of political decision that it really doesn’t relate to learning and knowledge.
I don’t know what it is in your religion or your culture but as a muslim and  an Iranian we learned that sharing our knowledge is human action that all of us are supposed to do it.
and it is really nice if all the human beings be wise enough to get the good points of every  culture. maybe we’ll have a better life.Quite confused about the Pro/free as well 
When I created the account and a pop-up about 7days pro trial came up, I clicked on the background trying to escape it, as I did not want to start it.
After couple of days I realised I had the trial started anyways. I have started Python 3 course, which I have finished in 60% yesterday, only to realise that it was part of the PRO courses and I can’t continue it today without subscribing. It is really not clear for someone who just registered what is free and what is not, especially if you upgrade to account to PRO right away.
Anyway, enough complaining - my question is if there is big difference between Python 3 and Python 2? Is Python 2 still useful, or is it somehow becoming outdated?
Since Python 2 course is free, I am considering to do it, can I just skip the topics I have done in Python 3 course and be fine?Hi @noispaxen, I want you to know I’ve passed along the description of your confusion to the team that designs those pages.

195,Troubled with Computer Science Pro Path,Random,4,79,"I am 16 years old coder from India and I am seriously disappointed and troubled after completing pro path.
I recently finished the Computer Science Pro Path and things didn’t go as expected.
Months back one of my friends suggested me learning to code. I discussed that with my dad and he said that it would take me years to earn money from this field. Also, no one would hire as young as me and it would take me to atleast 6-7 years more to complete my school level education and then get a degree from a good college. I thought that age is no restriction in programming. I argued with him that this isn’t the case. I could easily get into a job or maybe freelance after learning to code and it didn’t required me learning from colleges or getting degrees to prove my skills. After a couple of days he agreed and I subscribed for codecademy.
I looked across different skill and career paths available and found that Computer Science suites me best. I recently finished this career path and felt confident that what I have learned must be valuable. Learning python and ruby from other sources was also a boost up for me.
But things didn’t turned out that well. I applied both for internships and jobs but no one showed any interest. Most of them didn’t reply and those who did said that they would have hired me if I would have been 18+. I thought that some work experience would be good and did a couple of projects included them in my resume followed the guidance from
here. Nothing did any good. I decided to get up into freelancing on sites like fiverr.com. I scrolled through freelancing jobs people offer and unfortunately nothing was related to what I have learned. I offered my work to several locals but it didn’t turn out any good as well.
This is actually very disappointing that after you learn something but it doesn’t hold any value anywhere around you. I guess my dad was right. What everyone wants is a piece of paper from a good college.

Thank youSet up the project in VS Code, connect it to Github and commit a lot so you can go back in case you mess up. But be careful in making too many changes. Most of the code is correct but there are some major areas that are broken. Check the basics first - for example that the css is linked correctly. Then ideally open up project next to the working web-site example (or the spec-sheet) and see how they compare. I worked from the top and did one section at a time. Use dev-tools a lot (right click and inspect) to see what is going on. If you get stuck then one option is to also inspect the working website and look at the styles there. It would help to be a little familar with flex and responsive design since that is used in the site but most issues are more basic.Thank you for the advice"
197,I need some advice,Learn From Home Club,6,76,"I’m working through learning Python, and am getting quite discouraged. I get to these challenges, in say Loops (the most recent section I made it to), and when I read what I am being asked to do… I just can’t put it together. When I click view solution, I can break down the code, figure out what it does and why it says what it says. I can also get passing score on the quizzes… but I can’t turn around and figure out how to actually write the code out from scratch. Does that make sense? It’s like I can hear and understand English but can’t speak it, which feels very very bizarre and discouraging. It feels like my brain just can’t process this stuff.
So, what should I do? I don’t want to give up. Should I power through all the Python lessons and start over? Start over right now? How can I get to the point where I can not just break down an alright written piece of code, but actually figure out how to do it myself?I totally understand what you’re saying as I’ve been there myself.
I think it’s a big step if you can look at a solution and break it down & understand what it’s doing (you know, talk it through). That means you’re learning. 
Do you happen to take notes while you’re learning?
Sometimes that helps if you can go back through things that you’ve written in your own words.
For me, if I’m confused by a question or directions, I break it down, or, write it in words that I understand, using my lexicon.  I have also found that while going through the lessons I copy my code into a Colab notebook, run the cell and then tweak it for various outcomes until I understand what the method or function (or whatever) is doing. I also check other resources if I don’t understand concepts from lessons—like official documentation or sites like StackOverflow or GeeksforGeeks.
Don’t give up though. Keep going! You’re learning a new language and it does take practice. (I remind myself of this often) While Codecademy is a very good site, I find if I use another website for coding, for example, repl.it, it helps keep me refreshed, and interested in learning new languages. Please don’t give up and keep trying! I actually copy the answer into a notepad, and type the explanation of each element out next to them. So, I’m building up a decent stack of notes. I’ve tried restating the instructions, reordering them, I don’t know, it’s like I’ve got a wall in my brain that won’t let me process the instructions. Thanks for the suggestions on resources!Another good way to get past problems is to create psuedo-code. This is like a list of instructions-written in English-on how to do the task, if one were to do it by hand (or if you were telling a friend how to write the code). Try to make it as codey-sounding as possible-use phrases like create a for loop which loops through the ""array_name"" array. Then, once you’re happy with this pseudo-code, you can turn it into real code.Yep, if you can explain what you’re doing to someone else, then that’s a good sign! That’s good. Whatever works for you. 
It takes some time for some concepts to solidify. For me, I find that practicing a little bit every day helps too. And, if you don’t understand something, there’s absolutely no shame in posting here in the forums and asking for help. That’s what the community is here for. Someone else might be able to explain your query to you that is understandable. "

200,Learn lua for beginners,Tips and Resources,1,51,"LUA is a simple language, this topic is MAINLY about rblxlua not regular LUA
Properties
LUA can manipulate many things like many scripting languages but lets start with the basics
When changing properties you need to ADRESS the object using parents and children
Just like this!
game.Workspace.Part
That will adress the part
Changing brick color
Changing brickcolor may seem slightly complicated but it is quite simple
game.Workspace.Part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("""")
Inside the quotation marks you can adress a color from the roblox color palet
Now lets manipulate some objects with transparency!
game.Workspace,Part.Transparency = 0.5
for example
MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS ADRESS THE GAME
True and false
Here are some properties that can be changed using the words true, or false
Such as
game.Workspace.Part.CanCollide = false
or
game.Workspace.Part.Anchored = true
Variables
Variables must be adressed with the word “Local”, then you must adress the part of the script you want shortend
such as
local variable = instanse.new(“Part”, game.workspace)
then the script is shortened
variable.BrickColor = Brickcolor.new = ("""")
Instanse.new("""")
Instanse creates objects via script and not placing a object manually
for example
Instanse.new(“Part”)
notice when you run that nothing appears
Well thats because it needs to be adressed to the game like this
Instanse.new(“Part”, game.workspace)
Run that and see what happens!
But now i want to change its properties! How do i do that?
Just like this!
local variable = Instanse.new(“Part”, game.workspace)
As we talked earlier that is how you create a variable
Now lets change it!
variable.Transparency = 0.5
Now lets duplicate it
Function generatePart(60)
That will create 60 duplicated parts!
I hoped this helped!if there are any suggestions

201,How can I learn LUA,Community,12,6.2k,"I’m new at coding, and I’d like to learn LUA first.
Anyone know where I can learn it?With a very easy google search 1.1kHello @dreadful012, Welcome to Codecademy!
Although you said you are new at coding, you also stated that you wanted to learn LUA first. I am curious about what information or source you read to wanna start learning LUA instead of any other programming language.
If you are newbie at coding, I would recommend taking one of the Codecademy courses to start learning about the basis of programming, like Python (easy syntax, readability), JavaScript (mostly used on browsers), Java (a bit harder at the start but widely used today on software development, mobile apps, etc), and so on.To make epic Roblox games, of course. Free documentation is on the website which someone has already linked, but since in-depth books are my favorite, I recommend investing some money in them to receive the best experience.I have posted before about some courses to learn LUA as programming language and also a great  2D Game Dev Framework based on it, which is called Love2D.
Here is my post about it: Learning Lua? 571It really depends on what you plan on using lua for, but since you have no experience on it, start with the official lua manual. It states everything you need to know about base lua from values to loops. Lua is a simple but powerful language, I wish you luck!Beware: Lua starts indices from 1. Just an FYI.I agree Codecademy is a very good place to start learning code. I am using it to learn a couple of languages right now. So I definitely advise.so there is no lua class here ?i need it too ! For Roblox Studio
I need it first than anythingDude lua is epic! I learned it as a newbie and am still a bit new but its cool that you want to learn luaLUA is very easy to learn
If you were to use it roblox here are some handy things
Local (NAME OF VARIABLE) = (Local creates variables and you MUST give it a value)
Instanse.new = ("""") this will create a object via script and you can do many other things with it
–this is commenting on lua
If i were to create a variable like this
local variable = instanse.new = (“part”)
it makes it a variable, to run that variable you can do it like this
variable.BrickColor = BrickColor.new
–That will change the color of the object the script is reading
You can also change other things like
can colide or anchored using true and false,
I hope this helped!"

First post here, but I wanted to get this question out here. I’d like to create a new forum software, and I know the basic coding languages (HTML, CSS, Java, jQuery) from the Complete Web Developer Course 2.0 on Udemy.
However, I can’t find much info on what languages I would need to know to create an amazing new forum software. I’m willing to learn, just trying to find the direction.
I’d appreciate any help on where I need to focus my time.
Thank you!The front end is not the only concern when it comes to creating forum software. That’s probably the easy part. There is a whole back-end concern that will need to be solidified. That means a database, login authentication, form validation, pre-processed response pages, requests, scalability, &c. The list goes on. It is not a simple matter.
We really must be fluent at front-end languages; that goes without saying. This is the part that affects the user experience. The back-end, though, that’s where we can break the user experience, literally. When all they see is a white screen, we’ve broken something. That’s kind of how failed responses turn out on the user’s end (client-side, front-end).A new forum software, eh @tylerh1994? A worthy cause. Let me know if you wanna talk through it at a later stage. Thanks for the response mtf! Yeah, definitely understand the importance of both sides. I was just wondering what back-end language(s) I would need to learn to start building my own custom forum software.
Would it be Python, Ruby, or anything? Combination of a few? Would love your input on what language(s) are best to dive into.We’ll need to rely on more experienced members to chime in, here. My experience is limited to PHP on the back end, and no database knowledge, whatsoever.
Linux is pretty much at the heart of the backend (mind Apache and Windows are major players). Understanding servers is at the top of the list. CGI plays an important role. The most powerful languages for that purpose are C++ (C# for .net environment) and Java but these days Node.js is front and center, too.
Frameworks are pretty much the norm, but finding the right fit is something that will take a lot of research and getting your hands dirty. Master SQL as no matter which environment you settle with, they all need that. (PHP is married to MySql and Apache, or at least that was the case years ago.)Ah ok, no problem. I’m still a “beginner” in code, so I’m still learning what all of this means lol. But I’ve been researching every language/framework you’ve mentioned so far.
If you have any contacts that you feel could answer this question, I’d greatly appreciate a connection.
Otherwise, I’ll keep asking around! Thank you for your info so far, has helped me to start diving into SQL (have done some PHP in the past, but need to brush up).The language isn’t the important part - the framework is. There are lots of frameworks in lots of good languages. There are also inadequate frameworks in bad languages, before start developing you need to see the coding 3 standard either they used the correct coding or not.
Some good choices:

Ruby + Rails
Python + Django
Javascript + AngularJS
Perl + Catalyst
Perl + Mojolicious

I would like to be able to work with as little amount of barriers as possible. Its probably not a bad idea to understand Apple products and Android products seeing that both have users. I’ve read also that their are apps being created to write code and it creates code across many platforms. Using a “wrapper” like phoneGap sounds like something i will also have to be familiar with.Update
For future native mobile app developing, the Google Play Store has also lengthened the time and strictness of submitting new apps. The link is an article about Google changing its app rules for new submitted apps.

React Native may be a good solution for you if you want to develop for both with a minimum amount of hassle – that’s how we developed our mobile apps on Android and iOS.
You can take our JavaScript then our React courses to begin working in this direction, then you can pick up documentation on React Native after you have the foundation in React.Thank you for the post on mobile app/native mobile app developing.

205,Successfully finished Python course . Any ideas what to do next?,Random,7,119,"Hey guys !! I completed the Python course . I’m kinda confused where to start now . Drop in your recommendations please . Thanks Hey Supri, did you read this?  Might be helpful!  https://www.codecademy.com/articles/whats-next-general 8Well, I’m a bit biased.  …
Perhaps look into the Data Science path. (?)
But also, keep practicing your new skills so you don’t get rusty.Learning python is just the first step of an ladder having infinite endings.
Python has a lot to learn, it’s on you to decide what you want to go with.
If you want to build games, you may search out and learn python modules like pygame, turtle, etc.
If you want to build apps with python you may wanna learn Kivy, another python library.
If you want to learn web scraping or other back end processes of websites you may wanna learn modules and libraries like beautiful soup, requests, etc.
Want to get into hacking, learn modules like socket, scapy, hacking (it’s actually a module name), subprocess, os, sys, etc.
Or you might want to start with data science (check out the codecademy career path it’s really great.)
One other possibility is Computer Science. (AI is hot topic nowadays)
But all ends up on researching. You need to know about your interests, search modules required to make things which match up with your interests, start learning them and create some cool projects.
BEST OF LUCK  Thank you I’ll do my research You should definitely try out something if that interests you. But remember, it’s fine if you don’t like it after you start. Just leave that in your past and start something brand new!
Best wishes with you my friend!!!  I love your energy armaan! This is the passion I need with coding! I’m starting to wrap my mind around some concepts, enabling me to implement some newly learned code soon! My pro subscription here has ended for now, but I am going to take a Networking Engineering course in the meantime until I can get paid access again!Thanks dude.
I hope you achieve what you want and become a successful programmer.

207,Thank you Codecademy!,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,548,"Hello guys!
I would love to express my gratitude to the developers of this website and also tell you a little story how Codecademy affected me personally. My first contact with coding was already at university (civil engineering) where I started to write some basic scripts on my Texas Nspire calculator, from there I have moved on to Python and Visual Scripting (Dynamo) where I have also done my masters degree.
After finishing university, I was offered a job at a big software development company in Europe, called Nemetschek to work for one of their brands called Allplan. My first work there was as a Technical Consultant, but because I was always fascinated by software development it was the perfect opportunity to learn how everything fits together. In 2020 after Covid-19 hit, we were force to work from home, so I had more spare time and I have joined Codecademy-Pro, which has really changed my life. After 7 months of learning everyday here at Codecademy, reading books, trying my own projects. I was given the opportunity from head of development to join the development team, because they were amazed how much was able to learn in such a short time. And for this I would like to thank you guys, you gave me the inspiriation, motivation and knowledge… And it all started with the 30-day coding challenge. In addition it also made it possible for me to start a side business doing web development. Thank you! I would never have done it without Codecademy!! Cheers!All the best man. An inspiring story indeed. I am on a similar road but in a different role as a growth marketer.Code academy truly has helped me too, I really think it helps me, and almost anyone that uses is. Good luck. Wow, what a story!

210,Weekly Poll for October 26,Random,2,69,"  Welcome to Our Weekly Poll 
 Topic:  Code Linters 
Hello Everyone,
A code linter can make your life easier by identifying syntax errors, formatting or incomplete statements,  as well as, helping with formatting.

Do you use a code linter?12votersShow vote
 Feel free to comment on your favorites below. I don’t always use linters for my personal projects (though I probably should), but once you have more than one person working on a project it’s very important.  I collaborated on a Python Django project a few months ago and we used Flake8 1 and Autopep8 1.  Black 3 is also a good linter for Python.Unless you’re writing your code in a pure text editor, like vim or Notepad, you’ll probably be seeing the benefits of a linter. You might not know about it, because editors like Visual Studio Code have them for the most common languages out of the box, but they’re almost certainly there.
Incidentally, if you are coding in vim - serious kudos. 
I can write functional code in Notepad… but I like the convenience of a good code editor. "
211,Where’s LUA?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,4,923,"ROBLOX is one of the biggest online games out there, where you can program and make your own games to share with the community. There aren’t many tutorials online on how to learn LUA (and if I’m not wrong LUA is modified for ROBLOX), there are YouTube tutorials, even a wiki. But those are the only sources. Many people have tried to make a game on ROBLOX, but they simply can’t due to the fact that the LUA is one of the hardest languages to find on the internet.
Not only for this platform called Roblox, but for many other applications.
Talking about money, there are many kids out there willing to pay to learn LUA just so they can make their own games in ROBLOX.Lets just get something straight here, Lua was not made for Roblox. Lua was made to increase customization in software.
Before I give you a bunch of lists for online tutorials, we should discuss the money thing.
Lua was made in 1993, so naturally there are textbooks available on it, not to mention you can hire a private tutor if you so desire.
Now the links,

213,What was your win this week?,Random,13,788,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not! 

Did you create a GitHub account and upload a project there?
Did you start a new course?
Did you finish a personal project?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! Coding-related: I started on some of the newer material on the DS path (they revamped/updated it! WoooHoo!!  ) and continued my streak.  
Non-coding related, I finished a scarf (crochet) that I was making for my Dad AND I started a new one. Lately, I’m digging these skeins of variegated yarns. Actually coding related for me this week!
I bought a web domain earlier in the year, with the intention of putting stuff on it (as well as using it to mess about with cloud DNS like Route 53).
Didn’t want to leave it parked and racking up ad revenue for the registrar, though, so I ripped a quick Bootstrap template from a free template site and chucked it up with no content except “Coming Soon” and a link to a friend’s business (he’s a Ruby dev based in Berlin) in case someone actually wanted work doing and somehow stumbled on my site…
That was 9 months ago… but this week, I finally got around to replacing that horrible Bootstrap template (and the gazillion1 dependencies it somehow needed) with a better page…
My inbox is better already, as I’m no longer getting security alerts for dependencies that need updating for a page I didn’t build…
Glorious. 
Hopefully it won’t be another 9 months before I get round to fixing the fact that the new thing isn’t responsive… and doesn’t work on mobiles… 

Edit

I’ve looked at the dependency graph on GitHub… a single page Bootstrap template, right… nothing super complicated…
There’s 399 dependencies… What!?

Coding related, I decided to go back to all the courses I left unfinished and finish them, starting with the Python course. I have to finish the Files and Function Arguments sections 
I can’t wait to feel that sensation of actually finishing stuff again  
Non coding related, I drew what is now my profile picture. It’s my best digital drawing so far, I’m so proud of myself  
P.S: I also baked oats 'n apples muffins…with amaranth flour. It was an accident, I can’t believe I mixed up the amaranth flour with the oats flour  Surprisingly, though, they came out truly delicious and VERY different from when I use the oats flour  Coding related: Got back into the swing of coding after a short break. After an hour’s review over the cheatsheets and a bit of practice, I’m back to where I was.
Non-Coding related: I had an interview with the Open University for a software engineering apprenticeship. I didn’t get through to the next stage as I found out just an hour ago, but I don’t really mind. I still consider it a win since it’s my second interview and I guess it just counts as practice.
Win #2: I just found out that there’s an intensive coding bootcamp nearby where I live and upon completion, you may be given a place as an apprentice. Gonna try that out 


 lisalisaj:

Did you create a GitHub account and upload a project there?


Reminded me! Uploaded an old Java project focusing on OOP (it was a simulation of an IKEA warehouse and point-of-sale system).
Also: found time and I’m almost done the HTML course  .My win this week: completing the (this year virtual) NYRR New York City Marathon 2020.
image1170×2532 126 KBWooo!!! That’s awesome! 
I guess this week’s win is that I’m getting out more often. I’ve been head down with studies and coding and haven’t found much time to go out and get some fresh air. I’ve just come back from a 10km walk. It’s not overly much but it’s amazing how much a bit of exercise and fresh air can impact your work ethic. I’m zooming through my course at the moment whereas I’d usually take a few breaks here and there.
Another win, I’ve become more organised, cleared my desktop and put some things up on my pin board above my pc  which I need to remember. It’s really handy for memorising tricky things in coding. Definitions etc. Anyway, that’s all from me. Have a good day My win is that I am learning on Codecademy for 227 days now!
I have found a work experience position! This is similar to an internship. That is because I am in a reintegration trajectory.
I am going to work as a front-end developer at a marketing agency. They also build websites. We start with 2x 3 hours a week. I’m going to work from home.
My brother has sent me some chocolates to congratulate me.
I switched from the webdevelopment path to the front-end engineer path and I ordered some of the optional books, I just picked them up from the post office.

I knew that it is possible possible to use for loop in that capacity and I recently discovered the way to do the same with dictionaries. Yesterday, I was able to find the way to combine them both. Here is thee code to illustrate it:
def play_song(song_name, artist_name):
    print(f""Playing {song_name} by {artist_name}"")

album = {
    ""Track1"": {""song_name"": ""privokzalnaya"", ""artist_name"": ""Garic Krichevskiy""},
    ""Track2"": {""song_name"": ""skripach_v_zakone"", ""artist_name"": ""Garic Krichevskiy""},
    ""Track3"": {""song_name"": ""Salvador Daly"", ""artist_name"": ""Garic Krichevskiy""}
}
for key in album.keys():
    play_song(**album[key])

Also, I did upload a project on GitHub. It is a code from the Real Python article on Inheritance and Composition in dataclass syntax. It was done a while ago, but was uploaded yesterday. It gave me some trouble, but solution end it up to  be very simple. Here is the the link to GitHub Repository if anyone interested: https://github.com/keisoko/supreme-succotash 10Congrats Rosita! Could you share a little about your job search? What did you do to make yourself stand out, and whatever else you think is helpful. I’m been coding a lot, and will soon try applying in earnest, but am very nervous as it is a new field for me.Hi! Thanks! Searching was hard because of Covid19. Because I wasn’t searching for a real job, i didn’t have to apply. But I did sent my resume and told them what my experience was. My position is similar to an unpaid internship. I know a lot of people and I am good at networking. I posted on LinkedIn and on Twitter that I was looking for a working experience position. I am in a reintegration trajectory and I have help. So my advice would me share the message, write a good letter and resume. Use LinkedIn.
Good Luck!"

My code was as follows:
const arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const nestedArr = [""a"", ""b"", ""c"", [""x"", ""y"", ""z""]];

// Callback function
const timesTwo = (num) => num * 2;

// forEach
arr.forEach((number) => console.log(timesTwo(number)));

// map
console.log(arr.map((number) => timesTwo(number)));

// Chaining iterators (map, then filter)
console.log(arr.map((number) => timesTwo(number)).filter((num) => num > 10));

const singleLayer = nestedArr
  .reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr)
  .split("""")
  .filter((element) => element !== "","");

console.log(singleLayer);

console.log(nestedArr.flat());

                You can start with either. Full-stack is basically just knowing both well enough (it’s a simplification but you can think of it that way for now). 
I’d recommend whichever one you seem to enjoy more at first.

216,Is this a bug? Analyze Data with R: No error messages in R projects,Bug Reporting,0,51,"I’m working on Analyze Data with R 1.  In the lessons (all of them, I believe), if I put in code with an error, an error message pops up just fine.
In the projects (all of them, but I linked to the last one), if I make an error, there is no error message.  Instead, the html version of the notebook just fails to make the change.  There’s no error message, and the code blocks on the html version don’t change (they don’t display the incorrect code, they don’t display any changes at all).
If I put in several lines of code and the last line has an error, none of it executes or shows up in the html notebook code blocks even if the lines are not related or dependent on each other.
If you want to reproduce, try this:
summary(psid$labor_income) (run to display a summary of the labor_income column–great)
now add:
summary(psid$age) (this is correct, should produce a similar summary)
summary(education_years) (this line is incorrect, it doesn’t have the data frame title)
When I run the second set of code, nothing happens in the html at all.  It doesn’t show the new lines of code, it doesn’t print the summary of psid$age, and it doesn’t give me an error message.

Why is programming so hard ?Anything worth doing is hard! That’s what makes it fun and interesting for me. When I try to code something and I feel lost or overwhelmed, I just remind myself that there must be a solution and it’s only a matter of time before I’ll find it.
Try to detach from the situation a bit and realize that getting stuck doesn’t mean you failed, because everyone gets stuck sooner or later. Getting stuck means you are trying and that’s important. Feel free to drop your questions here in the community and you will get helpful answers.Hey there, welcome to the community 
I know exactly how you feel, but don’t worry, experiencing frustration while learning to code is normal. Just remember to take a break, and if you’re having trouble understanding a concept, don’t beat yourself up. It’s ok, we’re all here to learn. Just don’t give up.
I also wrote this article 3 a while ago, it might help you out Thank you so much . I’ll try my bestThis isn’t something to get demotivated. We all feel the same. You need to understand that you won’t get the solution to problems in the first go every time you code.
Whenever you feel demotivated you just need to detach yourself from it. Read a book, go for a walk, scroll memes (share with us too if you find something really hilarious), do something else but just divert your brain off it. Then come back later and think of it from the start."

219,How I Landed A Real-World Dev Job In 6 Months,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",38,13.5k,"Hello world! I recently landed my first role as a Web Developer with a local company and it all started with Codecademy. I thought it would be useful to share my story and help answer any questions in the hopes of helping others achieve their goals as well!
Earlier in 2018, I found myself at a bit of a stand still with my career. I was working as a Union Representative, so I was negotiating contracts, handling grievances, etc. I felt a bit stuck in my current role and saw no real way forward, so I sat down and tried to hone in on my real passion. I started researching possible career moves without going back to school and realized that a lot of people seemed to be learning to code and do web development and were getting hired without any Computer Science degree, but just having the skills to do it. I had always been interested in programming and had dabbled in it here and there, but had convinced myself in college that I was no good at math, so I could never possibly learn how to be a real programmer. But, having seen so many success stories of others who had done the same thing I was trying to do, I figured I had nothing to lose. So, in April, I signed up for the Codecademy Build Websites From Scratch Pro Intensive and lo and behold–I loved it!
I am married and had a 1-year old son at the time, along with my full time job, so I found myself mostly up late at night coding and learning everything I could. My wife is is nursing school, so after putting our son to bed, we were both locked in to our laptops, pursuing our goals. I learned HTML, CSS, and dabbled a bit with JavaScript, enough to the point that I could make my own portfolio site! I added in a simple web app, a beer recommendation website that interfaced with the Untappd API and gave users recommendations based on their previous checkins. Nothing crazy, but it showcased my ability to navigate basic JavaScript. From there, I also added in my Codecademy capstone project, and a simple site to showcase my homebrewed beers.
Once I got the portfolio up and running, I redid my resume, listed my past experience as well as my “Freelance Web Developer” work (which I never got paid for, mind you, but listed out everything I had done related to Web Development). I put Codecademy down under my education, as well as some freeCodeCamp certificates I had done while using Codecademy. I started attending a weekly Code & Coffee meetup (since evening meetups were out of the question with my son around), and started networking and became active in the #100DaysOfCode on Twitter. I kept my education going by doing all the courses I possibly could on Codecademy, and also supplementing a bit with freeCodeCamp and Udemy courses.
I had read plenty of resources about how to search for jobs, and when to know you’re “ready” and the consensus seemed to be that you’ll never really know when you’re “ready”. All you can do is start applying and potential employers will let you know whether you’re ready or not. So, I started applying! I probably applied to close to 100 jobs and had a couple phone screens, and did one coding challenge that I really didn’t do so well on, but it showed me areas I needed to improve.
Then, I got a call from a company 5 minutes from house saying they wanted to interview me. Mind you, this is not a tech company–it’s a company that sells printer ink and various other coatings, adhesives, etc. I did the phone screen, made it to the next round, and was really able to show off all the soft skills I had learned in my previous job, as well as hold my own talking about various technical projects I had worked on, how I thought through design elements, and what my workflow was like. They really liked my ability to communicate (being a union negotiator/organizer certainly helped with this!) and they decided to bring me on in a sort of hybrid role to do some marketing automation, content creation, as well as help out with the web development for their WordPress site.
I started this job about a month ago and holy cow–it’s amazing. I never would have dreamed that I’d be able to make a career change in just over 6 months, but it happened! Some nights were really rough (JavaScript algorithms really gave me a run for my money!), but all the hard work, combined with a belief in myself that I could do this, and some good luck and timing, really paid off and got me where I am today.
My advice for anyone going down this path is to look at jobs in your area, see what skills are desirable, and learn as much about them as you can. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript will pay dividends and from there you can pick up almost any other programming language somewhat quickly. The concepts are what matters–syntax is always a Google search away and you can figure it out, but the concepts are what you need to learn to make that happen. Start building projects–any project and learn what you can out of them. Redo your resume, put up a portfolio, and start getting yourself out there. Network, go to meetups, get active in the community, and there’s a wealth of information and people willing to help you out on your journey. And then, start applying! A lot of employers these days are willing to take a chance on someone without a CS degree as long as they show they’re able to learn and take feedback/direction. The worst thing you can get out of applying is a rejection–and then you’re no worse off than you were if you hadn’t applied at all. But eventually, you will find someone ready to take that chance and develop you.
In closing, I hope this was helpful and will inspire folks to keep pushing through and drudging through the drudgery as we say in our household. Happy to answer any questions and happy coding!


 tomraley:

I had read plenty of resources about how to search for jobs, and when to know you’re “ready” and the consensus seemed to be that you’ll never really know when you’re “ready”. All you can do is start applying and potential employers will let you know whether you’re ready or not. So, I started applying! I probably applied to close to 100 jobs and had a couple phone screens, and did one coding challenge that I really didn’t do so well on, but it showed me areas I needed to improve.


I like this attitude.
Also wonderful story.Nice that you got a job @tomraley! =)
Also, thanks for sharing your story with us.Very good mate, I will write a success story just as this one, one day.@kekpop If you will it, it is no dream Nice job getting a job in 6 months! Wow!I know. That seems fairly short actually…That is so great. First job in a new field is the hardest. I got started a similar way…just wanted to get out of a rut so started studying web development. Now I’m back brushing up on new skills during a lull at work. BTW, soft skills will help you tremendously in this career.It fairly short for some people-other, maybe not as much.Yes, its true it depends on what type of person you are sometimes, but if the right things you should get hired.I loved reading your story! I just started on my journey on December 8. I am working through CodeAcademy Python 2 and also a Head First Learn to Code book. I am looking forward to sharing my success story in 2019!Awesome story! Thanks so much for sharing. Gives me hope for my job search.So glad that I read this story. I’m on a kind of the same way you pursued, still in the beginning of the learning process! Thanks for sharing.Amazing story Tom! I hope to have a success story one day!I think the free version of codecademy is definitely good to get you started and figure out what really interests you. Resources like freeCodeCamp can also help, but the learning environment of Codecademy Pro was really beneficial for me personally.Amazing story Tom! I hope to have a similar one someday!Awesome! Just read this. Thanks for sharing Great story! I won’t get a job in this profession unless I ditch my teaching job though @tomraley Congratulations that’s awesome I hope all goes well with you and your career. Also if you don’t mind I would love to see your portfolio page.Thanks! My portfolio is here 282.
Currently working on adding in a blog as well, but this is basically what I had up when I got hired. All the code is on github as well if you’re interested."
220,New Three Career Paths for Web Development - What should I do now?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",11,351,"Hi,
I read Codecademy will remove Web Development from the Catalog, instead there will be three new career paths: Full-Stack Engineer, Front-End Engineer, and Back-End Engineer.
I’ve already completed 50% of Web Development career path. What should I do now? Finish the whole career or move to some of these new careers. Or what should I take into account to decide what to do?
Thanks.One would imagine that, since the existing Web Dev path is a blend of front- and back-end tech, that the “Full Stack Engineer” path would probably be a similar experience.
Front-End would likely focus on HTML, CSS, and libraries like React, where Back-End would deal with Express and Node…
I haven’t seen the new paths, mind, but this is what I would personally expect the content to resemble after the change. If you are at 50% in the Web dev path, you must be around chapter 8 (Learn command line) or chapter 9 (learn git) right? If you finish chapter 10 (React) then you will have covered all of the front-end tech in the current Web Dev Path.
In that sense, it would make more sense for you to go for the Back-End Engineer path to cover the other half of the stack and be full-stackI see. So, what I need to do is wait till Codecademy release the new paths. Then I would be able to compare them  and decide.
And yeah that’s true, I’m in Learn command line. I didn’t know that chapter 10 is the last front-end’s chapter. Knowing that, it will be really helpful when comparing the future Front-End Engineer, and Back-End Engineer paths.
Thanks!!Hi There,
The launch for the new skill path happens on the 20th.
You have about 5 days to do whatever you want to do. I suggest you keep going until you finish all of react including the jamming project.
All of the progress you made in the web dev career path will be allocated to the new career paths depending on what you’ve finished.
So lets say you do want to focus on the Front End Career path only. Instead of you being at 50%, you may end up being at 40% due to new content being added/updated.
If you aren’t ready to learn react, I would suggest you go back and focus on learning more JS fundamentals like array methods, etc.


 glennlaw:

All of the progress you made in the web dev career path will be allocated to the new career paths depending on what you’ve finished.


Sounds like we have to go full send and just click that “reset progress” button  
Time to crush those new Paths!AHAHA! Yes. I’m truly excited!Changes to the Web Development Career Path
Good news! We’re updating our Web Development offerings with the creation of three new Career Paths.
Why?
The world of web development is constantly changing and it can often feel daunting to understand what one should learn. The good news is that Codecademy is updating our offerings to match best practices and industry-favorite technologies!
We will be adding three brand new Paths to our catalog: Full-Stack Engineer, Front-End Engineer, and Back-End Engineer. These new Paths will replace the existing Web Development Career Path and usher in a new approach to learning in the Web Development domain.
These paths are full of brand new projects, articles, and curated resources — including books and documentation — to introduce and scaffold important concepts in web development. We’re releasing a brand-new content type: the Portfolio Project, which can help you move off the Codecademy platform and develop a portfolio that will make you stand out to prospective employers. Additionally, we’ve added new interview preparation material to make sure you’re ready for when you start applying to jobs. Finally, we’ve integrated contextual items to clarify what you’re covering in each unit and how it relates to your overall Career Path journey.
How does this impact you?
If you’ve already started or completed the Web Development Path, you will still be able to access the path from the ‘My Courses’ tab on the dashboard. However, it will no longer be accessible from the Catalog. You won’t lose progress on the coursework that you’ve completed and will be able to continue and finish the Path.
If you’re interested in enrolling in one of our new Paths, you’ll find that any progress you had in the Web Development Path will be carried over — no need to start from scratch! However, you may notice that your overall progress percentage has decreased, as there is more content included in the new Paths.
When?
The Full-Stack Engineer and Front-End Engineer Paths will be added to the catalog on Tuesday, October 20, 2020. Around this time the Web Development Path will be taken off the catalog, but will continue to be available to learners who have already started it.
The Back-End Engineer Path will be added to the catalog on Friday, October 23, 2020.
Take a look below to get an overview of the updates.

Recap
We’re adding three new Career Paths in the Web Development Domain and removing the old Web Development Career Path. The new Paths now include new content, cover additional important topics, and make sure to reinforce all of that learning with engaging cumulative projects.Is there a time limit to decide to switch to one of the new career paths or to stay with the current Web Development career path?At the moment there is no time limit. You can continue to access the old Web Dev Path through “My Courses”There is no limit. You can take any course in any time as your wish but for pro you have spend money monthly or annually. Thanks.Thank you very much Omy.lara. Can we practice together and how?"
221,What was your win this week?,Random,11,128,"Weekly recap time. What was your win this past week? It can be coding related or not!

Did you help someone? (teach one, learn two)
Did you try out something new? A new language, perhaps?
Did you finish a project you were working on?

Excited to hear about everyone’s win! I’m slowly working my way through the Chocolate Scraping project (BeautifulSoup).
I have a 90-day streak and I’m 72% through the DS path. Feels slow-going…but I guess it’s something. I just want to make sure that I fully understand everything.
I learned the importance of small habits, how they can make a big difference in your life if you’re consistent.
You would be surprised how much of a difference it makes to spend at least 5mins cleaning your room everyday (I’m usually a very messy person lol).
I also decided to draw every day, even if the results aren’t perfect. (And man, I improved so much in just a few days).
Aaaaand…I have a 12-day coding streak. Yeah, ik it’s not that much BUT it’s my longest streak until now  And I’ve honestly been learning a lot (I’m on the Computer Science path…26% through).
This is already kind of a long post so I’ll just quickly mention that I baked the most perfect cookies ever  …to compensate for last week’s.I’ve finally convinced myself it’s ok to slow down and actually explore and understand the concepts I’m trying to learn.  Progress was fast at the beginning of the web dev path but as things developed, the concepts grew more complex and I was still trying to speed through the lessons.
I’ve started helping answer questions on the forum which is helping me review earlier topics in the path and further my understanding.I cleaned up my room! And you may be asking how is that an achievement? Well I was not enjoying staying in a cluttered, musty room everyday for MONTHS, so it makes me happier when I walk into it and see my achievement.
Also, guess who solved a 4 kata on codewars? It was one of those speed tests as well (not fun).

If only more people realised that this stuff is a marathon and not a sprint… 
My win is completely random, but my barber has finally reopened… it’s good to no longer have hair all in my face… 


 h1lo:

Also, guess who solved a 4 kata on codewars? It was one of those speed tests as well (not fun).


Congrats! I’ve been trying to get myself away from homework, but to no avail.Thank you! Codewars is not easy at ALL.


 h1lo:

And you may be asking how is that an achievement?


Dude, definitely no. The day I finally finished reading the KonMarie book and finally organized my room, it was like one of the biggest achievements of my entire life  totally agree man, full-stack progress is really fast and it feels easy but as soon as you get started with javascript, you start to realize why very few people are able to do this.
anyway, consistency is the key, and it’s really fun talking to people in this community I spent here more time than I do on insta.   "
222,I’m starting a chapter for those making a serious career switch - if you know of one please connect me to them,Community,1,54,"Hi all,
I’m very happy with the Codecademy chapters initiative. As you may already know, this will only work if we “the people” utilize them properly. I have been doing the web-development course for way too long and I would like more structure/ discipline driven by a community of people that are going the same path.
Even with Codecademy making the learning experience so enjoyable, you’ll not always find it convenient to sit in front of your computer and get your 1 hour of coding lessons or so.
I want to form a chapter (or find one if any of you knows of one) that is:

Active, and has a semi-timely structure. I’d hate to turn it into school semesters but I’d love to harness some of the usefulness that came out of that in getting courses done without the negative effects of it.
Goal-oriented. I want to ace front end skills and have a front-end portfolio. I am torn between front-end and full-stack. But at this point I told myself, you’ll go all the way through the front-end path, finish it then worry about anything else. Seeing it all the way through is critical.
Led by not only me but by the other motivated people in it. I know myself, I know I will be lazy one day and not want to do the course, and I want to see that someone is showing up and doing it regardless and pick up the ball if I drop it. This is what teamwork is about, and since we’re all in the same shoes, we all get those days and we need to step up and push others on days when they are a bit weary.
It can be international, and it can be virtual. I really prefer in-person interactions but there are so many challenges against that it is only going to distract us from the main goal.
There will be meetup times where we all virtually meet up, there will be flexibility on meetup times. Nevertheless, there will be a timeline as mentioned in point 1 to keep us on track and accountable.
This will be tricky but there will be significant effort to achieve points 1 and 5 while not making people feel pressured by those moving through chapters faster than them or get a feeling of “I’m way behind, I’m dropping this.” we’ve all been there. And I want to ensure this doesn’t happen to anyone in the chapter. I’d love to brainstorm how with anyone like-minded and is in need of such a chapter like myself.

Anyway, I’d like to start such a chapter or know of one that exists.
So, who’s in?Hi, you’re in luck! Codecademy now has chapters all over the world! Perhaps there is one that you can join?

223,Codecademy and Applescript,Community,1,361,"What is the closest / best language or course to learn on Codecademy to reduce the future learning involved in learning Applescript?
Thanks
ShaunWow, this is a pretty old question I’ve stumbled upon. I hope you’ve had pleasant travels learning AppleScript!
I know AppleScript fairly well, as well as a few other languages. It doesn’t get a lot of love, I’ve noticed. I will be teaching a coworker AppleScript soon, and plan on using the Introduction, Conditionals, Functions, Scope, Arrays and Loops from the Learn JavaScript to get them started. Of course, encouraging them to finish the entire lesson  if they enjoy it.
If one can grasp those concepts, then walking in to AppleScript will be much easier since it’s all the same stuff, just with different syntax."

226,What was your win this week?,Random,13,382,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not! 


Did you learn something new–a language or a bit of code?
Did you finish a good book?
Did you help someone else?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! You know those weeks where you feel like they flew by and you don’t feel like you made progress, but in reality you did? That’s me this week.
I kept my coding streak going and am at 125. Which makes me think of 125th street in Manhattan and a Velvet Underground song. But I digress.
I go back and forth between python and the DS path. Mostly Python this week. Slow going but moving forward, right? Right.
 I started using Pyxel as a simply game engine, and started a small project to practice its ins and outs. So far I am enjoying it, but given it is still rather new, documentation is sparse.
I went big and got the Viper 770 keyboard as the latest edition to my hodgepodge desktop 
Definitely worth it, as the programmable keys are already saving a lot of time.Not coding related, but I’ve finally got the rear wheel and brake of my bike back into full working order! That is a serious keyboard!
(I had to google b/c I’m unfamiliar with it.)Hey everyone, just started my journey to learn coding about two days ago and I’m about to decide which career path I want to start down. My goal is to learn/become proficient in 4 languages of coding by the end of November. =)


 dakpeeples:

My goal is to learn/become proficient in 4 languages of coding by the end of November. =)


If you are the type who can learn that fast than go for it, but be careful not to rush too fast when learning. I have seen quiet a few people, including myself, try to rush learning a language when they first start, and if you let yourself rush too much, you may end up at the point were you can understand some portions of syntax, but don’t truly understand the language.
You may be able to learn quicker, and I in no way imply that you cannot, but take for example that I have been practicing Python for around 6 months now, and still would not consider myself any were close to being an “expert” (insert any other term you prefer here).Finished the Learn Java course here on Codecademy! Though it was more of a refresher and review for myself.
Next: HTML + CSS.I got to 50% of the Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages skill path!Reposting here after realizing I had replied to the one from 2 months ago:
Honestly I think we are kinda taking it for granted by now but my biggest win for the week is probably that I’m still covid-19 free? I don’t know if through sheer luck or my feeble attempts at wearing a mask, staying home whenever I can, and washing my hands all the time (honestly, I spray alcohol every time I go in our out of a store).
Like I said, it doesn’t sound like much months into the pandemic, but I’m still immensely grateful that me and my immediate family have remained covid free, especially my mother’s side where I got 4 family members working in healthcare (3 nurses, 1 doctor/surgeon).I finished the Python Chatbot course! It took me so long (it was so hard) but I did it! I hit a new record streak of 95 (I lost it, but nevermind that).
Not coding related – I did well on my exams! I’m applying to university soon with a major in computer science, wish me luck!
P.S. if anyone has any tips on studying computer science at university, feel free to reply, I’d appreciate it a lot.All the best at university, and congratulations for finishing up your Python Chatbot course.!!!
Being a CS student myself, I have learnt a lot (but let me mention 2 of the things).  I have come to know that lectures will really never teach you everything(at least what you need to be relevant in the rapidly changing tech world) So, ensure you are grasping your class content as well as trying to learn stuff on your own. Being on Codecademy already gives you an opportunity to learn new skills that they won’t teach you in class.
The other thing is: do not be a jack of all trades and master of none. What I mean is, do not rush to learn everything at once. When you choose to learn, say Python, strive to understand the concepts well before you choose to jump to another language. At least you should be able to comfortably solve problems in Python before you jump to another one. Otherwise, you will be all over the place but not be able to do much in any of the languages.
That’s all for now, I wish all the best as you pursue CSThank you so much! That’s really good advice actually, I was debating for the longest time whether I should continue diving deep with Python or try another language, but now it looks like I’ll put off other languages for now.
And all the best for you too! "
227,Translate into foreign languages,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,85,"Hey!
I have been learning on this platform for about a week now and I really enjoy the learning process.
That is why I would really like to help you translate some courses into German (my native language).
Is there a possibility to do this? @lilybird
Best Regards,
JanYeah, this will be great 
I don’t have any problem learning in english but being able to learn in your native language will make things a bit more easy.
In my case, I am a native speaker of Spanish and I find a bit tiring reading english after few hours.
Maybe not translating the exercises but the lesson’s theory explanation should not bet a difficult task and will open the platform to many other people that are not confident enough learning in english language Hey Jan~ Welcome to the community! Thanks for the suggestion, and I will certainly pass this along to our Product team. At the moment, we do not have it on our roadmap to translate our courses to other languages. But, once we do, you’ll be able to see when we’re hiring for translators here: https://www.codecademy.com/about/careers 3Hey Lily,
I just wanted to offer my help. Maybe the community could translate some courses so that they are available in more languages.
I know that platforms like crowdin.com 2 allow this kind of community driven translation (at least for open source projects). It would be great if codecademy would have something similar 
Would be happy to hear your ideas 
Also feel free to write me if you have any questions!"
228,What was your win this week?,Random,27,631,"What was your win this week? It can be coding/programming-related or not!

Did you supplement your learning & solidify concepts?
Did you create something?
Did you help someone else?

Excited to hear about everyone’s win(s)! Working towards my first ML project. Continued my streak too, now at 104 days. 
Non code-related: I was successfully able to adapt my recipe for mac and cheese and made it vegan. I also meal prepped so I wasn’t standing in my kitchen at dinner time wondering what to cook for dinner. HUGE (relief) help. I don’t know why I didn’t do this sooner.Codecademy win: I completed the Web Dev Path!
Real world win: Out of curiosity I started looking at remote job postings.  I know that I’m far from qualified for a developer role given my current experience amounts to having completed the course here.
However, I did discover that my current skill set, combined with my new understanding of how websites work, has put me into a great position for some technical customer support roles where knowledge of HTML and CSS scores bonus points.  I’ve already sent off two applications and feel really positive.
I started coding as something to do during lockdown, I never envisaged it potentially starting me on a whole new career path.win: I got the new GoPro Hero 9
loss: with lockdown, I can’t travel with it and test it out
win: I know more about React now than I did last week
loss: everyone seems to be looking for jobs
win: my mom (nurse) hasn’t caught COVID-19 yet
loss: I can’t travel to Spain to see her right now
win: I’ve upped my running distance average to 6 miles per day
loss: the NYRR New York Marathon is another month away and it’s getting cold outside
win: my partner got her renewed passport after submitting an application in July
loss: same as before, it’s tough to travel right now anywhere
win: NVIDIA finally started selling their new monster GPU 3090
loss: I can’t afford one
win: only 97 days left in 2020
loss: only 97 days left in 2020
So I’d say all things considered, a pretty balanced week? It is about balance!
So, if I submit my passport renewal app now, I’ll get it next year some time. 
I can’t visit my parents either. This makes me quite sad.
Good on you for upping your running mileage!!
Running in cold(er) weather is my preference. Just gotta get the right shoes that wick sweat and have good treads so ya won’t slip and fall!  Hooray!!  Congrats on completing the Web Dev path!
Good luck w/the applications too!In restarting the comp sci path, I see some basic syntax that was cryptic before and now after 45 days straight of work on Python it’s almost simplistic. I’m also teaching myself to type and I got up to 40 wpm after being at 10 wpm at the start of September.
Enjoy the weekend and be well!it has been a productive week for me I learned and build new stuff also I just got my Responsive Web Design certificate finally  from freecodecamp

 No kidding! Weirdest year of my life.Coding-related: Finally I am gaining some confidence in writing SQL queries. (And one day, I will finish my coding courses, doggone it! Does anybody know how to get 26 hours in a day?)
Not coding-related: My friend asked me to crochet shawls for her daughter’s bridesmaids. My friend is the best knitter/crocheter I know, but she was too busy to make the shawls. I finished the shawls. I delivered the shawls. I’m still alive, and my friend says they’re great. I thought I was going to faint for the first time in my life…from sheer relief.
DSCN79995152×3864 3.68 MBomg! that’s such beautiful work! How many did you make & how long did that take?
I’m a crocheter and that’s some work I aspire to do some day!  Aw, thanks!! You crochet, too?! Awesome! I’ve actually thought about posting a random thread just to find out how many of my fellow coders/student coders also crochet. 
I made two and each one took me about ten or twelve days. I think I worked about 1-2 hours each day. It actually wasn’t a hard pattern, just meticulous.Yep. I started back up more seriously in Jan. r/n I have 3 WIP (2 small blankets and a scarf for my Dad).
I went on a scarf making binge earlier in the year as well. Everyone I know received a scarf whether or not they requested one… 
I find it relaxing (plus it works my brain in a different way)…unless I drop/add a stitch and have to undo several rows…hah.Nice!! I’ve been doing it for about eight years, and believe me, I still drop stitches. 
I agree; it is very relaxing. I frequently use it as stress relief. I also understand those binges…one time I made the same hat so many times that once when I was working late at night I actually dozed off but apparently kept crocheting in my sleep and didn’t drop a single stitch!
Mystery: why can I crochet in my sleep and not drop a stitch, but I when I am awake and looking at my work, I drop stitches? A lot. Congratulations, that´s awesome!I am forever counting stitches!  Hi!
Since March when Covid-19 started, I started the Skillpath learn how to build a website with Github pages and after that, I started with Webdevelopment Career Path, now I finished 60%. I am learning everyday and last week I reached a streak of 200 days. That day I finished the Learn the Command Line Course. Now I am at day 208 and almost finished with the Learn Git Course.
Maybe you think: wow she 's learning for a long time now. Wel, not only I have a child and a family to take care of, I also have cerebral palsy. Today it’s World Cerebral Palsy day (and National Accessibility Week here in the Netherlands The theme is Digital Accessibility) and I realise How furtunate I am to be able to learn to code and managed to do that for over 200 days now! It’s not obvious for everyone to learn and using the internet or other technology. That’s why I want to become a webdeveloper, to make sure everyone is able to use the internet. Accessibility is an important topic for people with CP or other disabilities. We need technology to make our lives easier and better. And I think it’s amazing that Codecademy has made a priority of accessibility on their website and in their courses. Because of tha it’s easier for me to learn to code. And I can take my time to learn. It’s not only the visible things, that make a website accessible (I’m not an expert) but it’s also the structure of the website and the way courses are build. Thank you Codecademy!!!

Hi there @rulesbyrosita! I haven’t seen you since Sonny stopped his Twitch streams. Sounds like you are still going strong with coding!  That’s awesome. We should definitely collab on a project soon Loving all the positive successes here!
To add mine to the mix - I made the decision to change careers in July and started the Web Development Career path at the beginning of August. Having had little else to do with my time, I spent most of everyday working through the course material as well as filling in any blanks with other resources. Last week I completed the Web Dev path on Codecademy!
I’ve spent the last few days working on user authentication with Mongoose and I’ll be diving into building up my portfolio site at the end of this week hopefully!

My question is, if I’ve completed a language-specific course (say, SQL), do I have to complete it once more if it is listed in Skill/Career Paths or will it be auto-calculated as completed and my progress % will automatically become higher?


 Solved by lisalisaj in post #2 


                Hi welcome to the forums! 
Yep, if there is course overlap it will show as complete in the different paths. Ex: I’m on the DS path and also completed portions of a previous SQL course a couple years prior. It registered as completed in my DS path. Same with the Python 3 course and overlap in DS path…
              
Hi welcome to the forums!
Yep, if there is course overlap it will show as complete in the different paths. Ex: I’m on the DS path and also completed portions of a previous SQL course a couple years prior. It registered as completed in my DS path. Same with the Python 3 course and overlap in DS path. It also doesn’t hurt to go back over the material just in case one has forgotten specifics. I’d like to add that the reverse is a little tricky.
If you are in the Data Science Path and complete the lessons of an overlapping course or skill path, you will not get the certificate of completion for that course or skill path. Those certificates are only awarded when you complete the lessons within the course itself, not it’s overlapping version in the Career PathThank you so much! This fully answers my question. Thanks a lot!
Yeah, this is exactly what I’ve encountered while doing my Design DB with PostgreSQL Skill - when SQL session was fully completed,  I noticed that it is mentioned as a 100% in the SQL Course and wanted to pin it to my LinkedIn, however I then went to the docs and found out this thing about the full certificate after Skill/Path is fully completed.
And so this question re. vice versa calculations arised…)"
230,Goal for 30-day challenge - Geocoding script,30-Day Challenge,1,77,"Hey there, I am going to commit to this 30-day challenge to see if I can create a python script that can bulk-geocode US addresses. I did a little bit of research and it seems there are a few packages that can do this type of work, like geopy and arcGIS. Does anyone have any thoughts on what to use, what pitfalls to avoid, or general steps?
To provide more details, I am interested in passing a csv that contains the following columns:

address
zip code
state
country

In return, I want it to spit out a CSV with the original address columns, plus two additional columns:

latitude
longitude

It sounds simple enough, but may be more challenging once I dive in, which should be good for a 30 day goal.

232,Python 3 – Classes lecture improvements,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,118,"To the Codecademy Team,
I have been working on the Python 3 course as my introduction to Python and have really loved it so far. That’s why, when I got to the Lesson on Classes, I was surprised to find it rather underdeveloped. OOP seems to be an incredibly important concept in Python programming, so I would really appreciate if Codecademy worked on more material (practice problems, more explanations, videos, etc.) to build a stronger foundation for these concepts for learners.
Again, I have had such a fun time learning on Codecademy and wanted to give my 2 cents on how to improve it.
Thanks!
#community:supportFor practice in the meantime, go back to the Student exercise (alice, tyler, lloyd) and create an OOP app from that scenario. It’s one lesson that comes to mind that can re revisited. There are likely others of similar nature.Codecademy is working well for me but, I think codecademy should make more videos on difficult topics like Loops,etc,… I stated with Python 2 which wasn’t a paid version and it was more easy and it had more content. More easy in the sense it had much simpler and broad explanation.I think PRO have to improve.The Python 2 course does contains a Loops Unit 3. You can also find the course page here 1, which displays all the units in the course."
233,Bootcamps!,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",6,184,"Hello Everybody!
I am rather new to programming and considering to enroll in a bootcamp (web development) to speed up my re-branching process. Are there any that you recommend or advise to stay away from? There is so many traps on this bootcamp market and I’d like to come as prepared as possible. I am based in EU and interested in an online bootcamp (I suppose that with all the covid situation it shouldn’t be an issue.) algthough I’m open to any efficient forms of learning.
Thanks for your opinions!If you’re looking to do it online why not try the web developer path here?There are many websites that rate bootcamps based on students’ experiences. Have you checked out those? (ie: Course Report, and the like).
As @winningblue mentioned,  did you look into the web dev path here or other course offerings?  (There is both free and Pro content.)I’ve heard really good things about this one: https://www.appacademy.io/immersive/course/?location=online 1
But most of the time, it will depend on your skill and dedication. Most well-known bootcamps will teach you the same stuff, similarly to how universities have more or less prestige while teaching similar material. It’s up to the students to squeeze every bit of value out of their program, to ask questions, network and take advantage of the bootcamp.
In New York City, these tend to be the best known bootcamps (in no particular order):

Hack Reactor
Flatiron School
General Assambly
App Academy
NYC Data Science Academy
CodeSmith
Fullstack Academy
Thanks for your replies!
@winningblue I am currenlty enrolled in the path but I assumed that the material covered in it would be more of a preparation for a bootcamp. It’s very useful but I doubt that I could land a job just after completing the Codecademy path.
@lisalisaj I have checked Course Report and SwitchUp, I’m just trying to get a broader view and possibly contact somebody who has done a bootcamp him/herself.
@irlfede Thanks for the recommendation! My dedication and determination levels are really high  Ideally I am looking for a bootcamp that will really challenge me and go a bit beyond the standard material.
So do you think that completing (successfully) a CC Web Dev Career Path would be enough to get a job? 


 bit2013331245:

So do you think that completing (successfully) a CC Web Dev Career Path would be enough to get a job?


The general understanding is that must people use CC Web Dev Career Path as a primer to go out and learn more things. I believe I’ve read a few success stories of people that got a job after studying CC material, but it probably depends on where you  are applying and what kind of job?I got about halfway through the web development career path here at codecademy, it really sparked my interest in self-learning, so I can really dial in on what I really want to do.

237,[Blog] Our First Mobile Development Path Has Arrived!,Community,4,8.7k,"codecademy-mobile-development.png2000×840
People all over the world are spending more time than ever before on mobile
devices. And with so much time being spent using smartphone apps, it’s
no surprise that our learners have been requesting more courses related
to mobile development.
Over the past year, 25,000 of you have highlighted mobile development
as a primary area of interest. Which is why we’re excited to share that
we’ve just released our first Pro Skill Path related to mobile development.
Develop Basic Android Apps with Javais designed for anyone that wants
to get started with Mobile Development, regardless of experience.
💡 If you’re interested in building iOS apps, we’ve got something new
for you too. We’ve updated our Learn Swift 400 course
with a collection of new modules, plus additional Pro-exclusive quizzes
and projects. You can find out more about that at the end of this article.
A look inside Develop Basic Android Apps with Java
We spoke with Codecademy curriculum developer Sara Rose to find out more
about the new Path — who it’s designed for, what you can expect to learn,
and what you’ll create. Check out the interview below.
Q: Who is the Develop Basic Android Apps with Java Skill Path right for?

This Path is for anyone who wants to get started with Mobile Development
generally, learn Android specifically, or even just wants a cool way to
apply what they learn as they learn to code! We wanted to make a course
truly designed for anyone and everyone looking to get started with Android
development, regardless of experience.
Never coded before? We’ve got you covered! This Skill Path will take you
from never having programmed before to understanding programmatic thinking,
Java syntax, and developing Android apps.
Already know Java and looking to get into Android? Simply skip over the
Java content you know and get your feet wet with Android.
Already know how to code but new to Java and Android? You'll breeze through
the Java syntax and be ready to go in no time.
Q: Will I really be able to build an app by the end of this Skill Path?

One of my favorite things about this Skill Path is that you'll begin working
on your capstone project really early on. Over the span of the Path, you'll
be building out Unquote, a fun and silly trivia quiz game.
android-skill-path-codecademy.gif1920×1080
As you learn new concepts, you'll immediately apply them to Unquote —
building out the project piece by piece. By the time you get to the final
project, you'll have written every part of Unquote and be ready to share
it with anyone in the world — literally.
One of the coolest things about Android is how easy it is to share and
distribute your apps. By the end of this course, your friends and family
can be using your apps on their own real Android devices.
Q: What skills will I take away when I'm finished with this Path?

We'll teach you how to program in Java and think like a developer — skills
that you'll be able to take with you to any other programming language
and be able to apply to wherever your coding takes you. Plus, we'll also
try to get you as pumped about Android as we are — it's such an awesome
platform with amazing global reach. Android grows and improves every year.
In this Path, you'll also be developing on your own computer off of our
platform. You'll be working with Android Studio — Android's Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).
Q: Once I finish this Path, what should I do next?

There's always so much more to learn! In addition to giving you the basics
to get started, this Path is designed to empower you to continue growing
as a developer.
If you enjoyed building a project from start to finish, we recommend checking
out the Create a Front-End App with React 100.
In this Skill Path, you’ll build an app to search for highly rated businesses
in a given city and connect it to the Yelp API to pull review data.

You could also learn Swift, so you're ready to be a cross-platform mobile
app developer. Let your ambition and ideas guide what you should learn
next. We'll give you the basic skills and tools you need to get running,
but there's no limit to where this programming journey takes you.
What’s new in Learn Swift?
For those of you that are interested in iOS app development, we’re excited
to share that we’ve made some recent updates to our Learn Swift 400 course.
Learn Swift, created by curriculum developers Sonny, Kenny, Galina, and
Alex (pictured below), will get you up to speed on the programming language
used to build apps for iOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and Linux.
swift-curriculum-developers-codecademy.png1104×695
We’ve rolled the Learn Swift course out a few modules at a time. We recently
launched the four remaining modules, which dive into Dictionaries, Functions,
Structures, and Classes. The course and all modules are available for free,
with Pro-exclusive quizzes and projects to help you take your learning
to the next level.
Kenny shares more about the course in the quick interview below.
Q: Who is the Learn Swift course designed for?

Learn Swift is especially good for beginners who have not written code
before and want a taste of the world of programming. The course assumes
no prior knowledge and walks the learner through from the basics of a Swift
program to creating mini programs of their own.
But Learn Swift isn’t just for beginners. It can also help more experienced
learners get a sense of the Swift programming language and its unique patterns
of development.
Q: What will I learn by the end of this course?

After completion of Learn Swift, you’ll know the fundamentals of the Swift
programming language. You’ll feel comfortable with writing Swift syntax,
creating mini projects, and you should be able to read through a Swift
program and understand the intention behind the code.
The fundamentals you’ll learn in this course cover common programming
concepts, including variables, data types, conditionals, functions, and
more. Once you’re done, you’ll be able to apply those fundamentals in order
to more easily pick up other programming languages as well.

241,Which companies look for newbie programmers for internships?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",6,240,"Hi y’all! I am about 25% completed with the web development path and was wondering about the next steps. I have also started a personal portfolio trying to get a resume website put together.
I’m curious if anyone has any recommendations on companies that has internships (paid or unpaid both fine) for new front-end developers or web developers. Any and all recommendations appreciated!
I know I still have more to go in my courses, but I want to begin scouting because some of these places do take some time to get back and by then, I would have gotten farther along in my learning.Have you considered using a job board or something like Glassdoor to find internship positions near you, or failing that searching Google for “developer internship” and seeing what comes back?May companies to that, you need to use job search boards\engines and filter by internship. Also, ready this 17Thank you! I just read through your post and will make sure to get started on that. As you mentioned in your post, companies don’t want to waste money. I also think companies might not want to waste time on new developers even if it’s an unpaid internship (not information to support this claim) which is why I’m curious if there are some companies/industries that are well known for helping new developers with limited experience. This being said, I fully intent to continue to practice on my own and build my own portfolio.I have done this. Similar to my comment to peachesmotorsports, I’m concerned if companies might not want to waste their time with new developers even if they are unpaid internships. I’m just assuming and I do fully intend to practice on my own and build my own portfolio. Just curious if there are specific companies or industries that are known for helping new developers. I have tried searching this information myself, but haven’t found much and was hoping someone here could share some insider knowledge.I meant that they don’t want to waste money therefore, they’re picky about what people they select for their internships, which is why you should be prepared and learn more that just what is offered here. Many companies take interns, they usually do it during a specific time of the year or when they have a new project.
You’re not going to find a list of companies here, if you truly want a list of companies that take interns then you need to talk to a recruiter or a staffing firm. Here you will find some suggestions based on experience, considering the global situation internships might be limited.
We also don’t know where you live so it’s hard to give you an option. The only company I would recommend is OverDrive in Cleveland, OH. They’re great people and they have an awesome product, I know they’re hiring but I don’t know if they’re taking interns. The remote positions they have are very rare.I’ve seen posts on craigslist, also its very competitive, find your secret sauce, and go with it. Maybe call around and ask? I do know that companies like people that are motivated and focused."

I’m the kind of person who starts a course, then sees a new, interesting one and leaves everything to start that course.
image3844×1920 277 KB
(hehe)
I know that’s not good though. I should finish one course before jumping to the next one. I think that’s one way of actually making progress with your coding journey.
But, progress.  Progress means you are closer to some specific goal. Does that mean I have to know exactly what I want to learn about, and stick to that instead of exploring every course there is to find what interests me? I think it should be a balance between both…what would you recommend?
Also I think you should track your coding progress in bigger spans of time. Because, you might spend one whole day trying to grasp your head around a single concept, and then feel like you should have done more. But believe me, spending time getting your basic concepts right will always be worth it. You can’t construct new coding knowledge on top of crumbling, weak knowledge.
And I think that testing your knowledge every now and then is really good. If you can’t use the knowledge you acquired in a real project…then what are you learning for? Exercise your skills every day, and every now and then (maybe every month?), challenge yourself with a project of your interest. It will show you your weak spots, but it also encourage you. I mean, isn’t in amazing to feel like you built something cool, that actually works, with the knowledge you acquired?
If it doesn’t work though, take a deep breath, a break, and keep learning. Research the topics you don’t quite understand yet. If you keep on going and don’t give up, you will eventually get there.
Failing is also making progress.
In a summary, I would say these things are essential to making good progress on your coding journey:

Have a goal
Work consistently towards it
Don’t rush it
Do what you couldn’t do before
Learn from failures
Love what you do, and do what you love.

Please feel free to add to these. And I would love to know how you work: work consistently in one course until you finish it, or explore all your available options until you find what you like? (Please tell me I’m not the only one who does the second one ). And how can you find a healthy balance between both?
Hope you have an amazing day 
(have you seen my profile picture closely? isn’t that THE CUTEST AND MOST PHOTOGENIC CHEETAH OF ALL TIME?!? alright goodbye.)I agree with some of the things you said. What are your goals? Why are you learning to code?This is actually gonna be really contradictory to what I just said…
I don’t have coding goals.
I started coding because of my Dad. He told me that coding is like the new reading. If you don’t know how to read…well, your possibilities get reduced a lot.
I’ve spent the past month working on one coding project that, to be honest, I don’t really like. But it’s a really important project I just have to do. It’s eating up my time for the things I like to do, cause if I don’t focus on it completely I’m just not gonna make it.
What I’m trying to say is that right now I’m a bit sick of coding.
I do like coding, don’t get me wrong. That feeling of looking at something you made like “Wow…I made this.” Does that count as a goal? Just to create cool stuff? And is it wrong if I don’t have a coding goal?
Someone I love said that it’s ok not to have a dream. He said to live your life your own way.This is me. 
I find some of these courses go too in depth with the theory and i like working quite practically- doing quizzes, problem solving, answering questions- building. Thats what keeps me engaged when it actually boils down to the learning. i started around 10 months ago and look back at where i was and where i am now- suddenly it doesn’t seem like an impossible feat for me to chase a career in tech. what helped me is focusing on one language at a time- javascript for me… then react. (assuming you’ve breezed through html and css). javascript is where i was really letting myself down… im so used to picking u most things without much thought but learning js has taught me to be a patient person I agree, you should do review also, it can really help.


How to get to the review page
When you are on the course page (where you would be to start the course or check your progress), click on one of the chapters of the course. There should be a button that says “Practice Pack”, click on it, and review the flashcards and take the quiz at the end!
CONSISTENCY matters guys, no matter what keep revising that you learned a week ago or a month ago best to do this is by working on projects.I agree with this, consistency does matter, but I also find out that editing prior projects with my newfound knowledge can also help me remember."

245,Building an Operating System,Corner Bar,8,356,"I am looking into building an Operating System,
Doing my research I have found most places say you need to learn C.
Is this true, or could I use something like Java, they seem very similar?
If I do need to know C, can anyone recommend a good place to learn about it?
I hope this is the right topic category, I was not entirely sure.In theory - any language that is turing complete. In Practice you are going to use assembly and c/c++
C is closer to the hardware and compiles instructions that are performant enough for the requirements demanded of an os. To properly boot a system you will probably have to arrange some assembly. Java is designed to generate bytecode not specialized machine code.Hello @8-bitgaming,
This is a very complex area of Computer Science. That being said, it can be undertaken, and, of course, has been undertaken.
As @fight_dragons has stated, C is closer to the hardware and, I believe, this is what early UNIX-based systems were coded in.
To learn C, I’d recommend you take a look at this book:


en.wikipedia.org 3



The C Programming Language 3
The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined.  The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today.  Because the book was co-author...






This is recognised as the gold-standard for the language, despite it being over 40 years old.
In addition to this, I’ve linked an academic article from a university local to me that expresses how to write a simple operating system. Just be aware that this is an academic article and will most likely presume prior knowledge on certain subjects:


cs.bham.ac.uk 8

os-dev.pdf 8
756.29 KB





Happy coding and good luck,
Richard.Thank y’all very much 
I know I am a long way off from being able to build one, but I figured if I want to do it, I better start somewhere.


 8-bit-gaming:

… I better start somewhere.


Have you checked out something like http://www.linuxfromscratch.org 8
Might help give you an idea of the architecture of an OS.Looks very interesting, thanks for the link!Hey, I am also building an OS right now as my project which I am going to submit in college. If you don’t mind, can we work together?
I am using this 3 (also posted by digital0457018858) book and also referring to this 2 YouTube seriesWell to be 100% honest, I don’t think I could be much help to yet. I’m still learning the ins and outs of just the C language and have barely glanced at languages like Assembly. I thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I could assist you on that low level of software yet.Okay then, no worries!"

Did you learn something new from a book or webinar, etc?
Did you FINALLY understand something that you’d been trying to get for a long time?
Did you help someone else?

Excited to hear about everyone’s win(s)! I extended my learning streak to 62 days. I’m now going (back) over hypothesis testing (statistical concepts) on the DS path.
I always hated math but for some reason I liked stats in grad school and did really well. (probably b/c I liked my stats prof. who really explained things and didn’t mind answering questions). 
I baked again this week. Yay, me. I made some toasted pecan “buttermilk” biscuits. I say “buttermilk” b/c I didn’t have any on hand and made my own (almond milk and a couple TBs of lemon juice).i farmed a lot of twitch drops using a bot i modifyed
lets just say the result was stonksI found a bunch of good books at Goodwill for CHEAP.
Including some coding books.Was able to find a great book on HTML & CSS to help supplement what I am learning on Codecademy and discovered Dev.to this week as well. Honestly I think we are kinda taking it for granted by now but my biggest win for the week is probably that I’m still covid-19 free? I don’t know if through sheer luck or my feeble attempts at wearing a mask, staying home whenever I can, and washing my hands all the time (honestly, I spray alcohol every time I go in our out of a store).
Like I said, it doesn’t sound like much months into the pandemic, but I’m still immensely grateful that me and my immediate family have remained covid free, especially my mother’s side where I got 4 family members working in healthcare (3 nurses, 1 doctor/surgeon).Nothing wrong with continuing this post, @kadidiadoumbia456256, @efeliciano515, @irlfede,   however I I just wanted to point out that this is an older topic and the newest one can be found here:

249,Feedback on Learn JavaScript course - Sleep debt calculator,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,0,59,"Hi! I just wanted to give a little feedback on one of the projects in the Learn JavaScript course.
It’s the ‘Sleep debt calculator’ from the ‘Learn functions’ unit, and I have to say that I really don’t like it as a project. Even to me as a relative beginner, I can see that it’s not at all a realistic way to approach the problem. It involves typing out manually repeated calls of the same function in a way that immediately makes you think “there must be a loop to do this better!”.
Similarly, it gets the learner to hard code a load of values into a long switch-case statement that could probably be better handled as key-value pairs in an object. Personally, to me as a learner, this kind of task feels a little like pointless busy-work and maybe even encourages bad practice.
I appreciate that you have to come up with projects that reinforce the content of the lessons without depending on additional knowledge from outside the course, and I’m able to suspend my disbelief most of the time! However, on this occasion, it just felt really obvious from the beginning that this wasn’t at all a realistic way of tackling the problem presented.
Thanks for your time!

I became frustrated because I didnt find easy help, i was sent through a lot of unnecessary think…Hey @gsawdy85, I’m moving your question to the Python category so you can get the help you need, but please do consider re-wording this question after taking a look at this article: How to ask good questions (and get good answers) 9I have an issue please … help me guys… how do you do the challenges? where are the challenges… in short?I am working through everything and anything to do with Python.
I started with Python2 and then went through Python3.
While I was working through Python3 I setup vsCode on my Kubuntu system and do side projects “riffs” on the tutorials when I want to dive deeper and explore tangents.   I also keep notes in vsCode Workspaces to keep track of challenging ideas and things I want to work on later.  These extra riffs on my own system are where I really build my excitement because I get a chance to see if I really understood the assignment, or if I am just following a recipe.
Having completed Python3 I am now working through the Computer Science track.  I really wanted to dive deeper into Classes and Objects and with Computer Science, I am getting my wish.I’m Japanese.

Works fine in Chrome. I know, “use Chrome”, but honestly I haven’t had a problem with Microsoft Edge so far and I think it isn’t a bad browser. Just wondering if this is a known issue.I also encounter this problem when using Edge, but it also happens in Chrome and Firefox sometimes (less than in Edge). Non-scientific assessment: It seems to happen more often when I have a slow connection, like when I’m on public WiFi.Hey Larry, at time of writing we do 4 support Microsoft Edge, but we recommend Google Chrome and Codecademy is optimized most heavily for Google Chrome.  That’s the norm for a great many sites across the web, and it’s not as much down to Edge being a “bad browser” so much as making sure that the experience is optimized for the majority 2 of users.
If you feel that you have found a bug or performance issue, consider reporting it!Has this been fixed, its two years since it was reported. Cannot pass the second page of the JavaScript basic course and I use chrome for work. Now as Chrome and Edge use the same background codex, I guessed it would just work. Trying the basic to see if its worth me going down this route with the paid option or taking the original route I’ve always taken by trial and error on a server with space for the same money per month!
Here’s the code below
console.log(‘5’);
// print number 5
Which works and shows 5 on the second frame, however the “next” option is greyed out and the script error pops up asking "" Did you use console.log() to print the number of weeks you’ve been programming to the console?""
Any ideas?
Cheers in advanceLet me ask around:
Just to be sure, you put
console.log('5');

but did you try:
console.log(5);

??
The validator may be being strict about whether it’s a string or an integer.Yeah, tried it both ways and it still showed number 5 in the parallel frame to the right once run had been selected, yet the coding frame showed the same error on both accountsSounds like a bug then. Let’s see if we can report it…I can’t re-create this issue, using the latest build of Edge (based on Chromium).
Can you try resetting the exercise, and try again? Yeah, reset it a few times. It’s the latest edge. All the software is bang up to date to

Non of these are working with me. I’m receiving message cannot find loader.js when trying to start server.js. Cannot open index.html with bash.  like the whole project is broken. Which version of Node are you using? I had better luck using Node 8 with some of the projects using sqlite3. You can use nvm to switch between different versions.node v12.14.1
npm v6.13.4
are the versions. Now it works. I created both tables and it starts running. Not sure that this fixed the problem. But still cannot start index.html from bash or run the app.Do you remember if there were error messages on npm install? I was first running Node 12 as well but that gave me lots of error messages when running npm install. I think the main issue was related to sqlite3 for Goldmedals. Downgrading to Node 8 solved the issue for me and gave just some minor messages. It is really easy to switch versions with nvm. If I type node -v in my current lesson in Codecademy it shows that they are using Node 7. I would give it a try to go back to v8, reinstall and see how it goes. I used v8.9.3.That’s certainly a valid way to interpret however, I’m not sure that was clear in the project unless you know your Olympic history. Thanks for your help!I downgraded Node version to v8.9.3. and still got the same many errors and another one -  Cannot find ..node_modules\sqlite3\lib\binding\node-v54-win32-x64\node_sqlite3.node. Then I have found an article that advised me to run - npm rebuild. That command fixe everithing and now on npm run start everything is ok (I mean no errors)… But stil this application does not want to run and I cannot see how it works. Rather than downgrade node, try the following:


npm outdated  and enter to list deprecated packages
Then,  npx npm-check-updates -u  and enter to update all packages
Finally, type  npm install  to complete the updates and update the package.json file
Did you do the other steps in the beginning of project such as open index.html and run node server.js?Yep, when I try node server.js, it says everything is loaded and nothing more. It is look like the app running but no pages, no browsers. Starting webpack and index.html leads me to error shown on attached pic.

Also just updated all packages and then npm run start:
Says: Data successfully loaded and that is all… no app for browsing, no browsers, no pages…As far as I can recall, the server script doesn’t open in the browser automatically. Follow the steps I outlined above (after navigating to within the project directory), then use your browser to navigate to localhost:0000 (where 0000 is the port number defined in your script).Tried many times and different ways and this is the result:

Then page load Error page that says Cannot GET /

I would consider unpacking the project file in a new directory and starting from scratch. You can always copy your written code over to the new files later on. Possible there is an issue in your index.html based on the msg. You should definitely see some tables and graphics when opening index.html manually. However, the data will only populate if the server runs successfully. It was a while ago I did this project but make sure to follow the exact steps in the beginning of the project. You have to actually open the index.html file manually in the browser as well as starting the server with node server.js. This manual procedure is different from some of the other projects which used create-react-app.This result (Cannot GET / ) is expected even when the project works if trying to access at http://localhost:3001/
The server is sending info on localhost 3001 but there is nothing on the ‘/’ root. However, for example http://localhost/country/norway would send the “Norway” object (once the server is running and you have written the SQL queries for the applicable routes. The key is to open index.html manually to start the “front-end” up. I agree this could have been explained a little better.If opening manuali index means to use command: npm run webpack open index.html while server running, then this does not work with me. I’m getting error. From my last attempt a minute ago:
err963×417 16.8 KB
If you can give me the starting comands step by step I’ll be grateful, because so far I’ve tried so many options…First, make sure to have done the first steps without major error messages:
npm install
npm run webpack
Then I think the next step is where the problem is. Instructions say to “open index.html”. This is NOT to be taken literally and simply refers to using the web-browser (for example chrome, edge or safari) and opening a local file on your hard-drive with your browser. In Chrome you can press CTRL-O to get a prompt for opening local files. I am running Windows 10 with WSL2 (Ubuntu Linux) so I do it slightly different (wslview index.html in my case). From windows command prompt you could do “explorer index.html”. Navigate to the index.html file and open it from the browser. So it depends a bit on your OS but hopefully this will help.I followed:
Linux
In Ubuntu or similar distributions:


Open your terminal and run  sudo apt-get install sqlite3 . Otherwise, use your distribution’s package managers.
Try typing in the command  sqlite3 newdb.sqlite . If you’re presented with a  sqlite>  prompt, you’ve successfully created the  sqlite3  command for your terminal. You can exit by typing  .exit  in the prompt and pressing enter.


and was successful.
I followed the instructions for this project, but when it came to

The past 30 days have been very encouraging and productive for me. Some highlights:


Finished the Web Development Career Path that I began when I first joined Codecademy


Completed the Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript Skill Path


Completed the recently updated React content (unit on function components and Hooks, along with the projects, etc.)


Took a short “break” to complete the Create Video Games with Phaser.js Skill Path


Helped in the forums as often as I could


I’ve had a lot of fun on the journey so far, and I know there are good things on the horizon. Some of the things I’m looking forward to on my next 30-Day Challenge are the upcoming changes to the Web Development Career Path being released in the near future. I’m going to do my best to complete the new paths while I have access.
Many thanks to Codecademy for giving me the opportunity to learn, improve, and challenge myself. Much love to the community for helping me stay focused and engaged!

How did you find the updated React content? It’s on my list to go back to it, as once I got my head around how React worked (it took me a little while) and it clicked into place I rather liked it. 


I actually loved the updated React content. In my opinion, they did a very good job of building on the knowledge already provided in the other lessons. For example, instead of just throwing up lessons that focused entirely on the use of Hooks by themselves, there were exercises that had the learners converting from a Class-based Component, with working code side-by-side. They demonstrated the Lifecycle feature differences in each of them.
My experience with the updated React content is one of the reasons I’m looking forward to the changes in the Web Development Career Path that I mentioned. There are many things listed in the news article that I’m interested in learning, such as Redux."
256,Where to look for Front-End Dev Internships?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,1.0k,"I’ve been trying to search for a front-end job lately in my area but most of them require experience in the field (which i dont have) and a bunch of other skills other than the ones I know being (HTML,CSS,Vanilla Js)  so I then turned to internships so that I could learn and get some experience but I can’t seem to find anything good there either. would anyone know of something like a good website for front-end internship or even apprenticeship ?
P.S I’m in Canada so US websites won’t do at all.In my experience, job postings will most likely always tell you that you need x years of experience. This is quite typical of a generation who just got out of school but is required “2 years minimum in a similar position”.
Why not give it a shot anyway? If you have something to show for, like a portfolio of front-end works, you could always inquire about an entry-level position. The salary’s not good, but that’s how you get one foot in.
Also, try to find patterns of required experience/skills in your area. Notice which skills/languages/frameworks/libraries are most in demand, and learn that.
Another option would be to go the freelance way, just to get yourself some experience and a portfolio. Platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr allow this, but that’s only if you can afford not getting paid much (because there’s a lot of competition on those, and not everyone has the same wage requirements).
Just a thought, though."

I think if you’re learning more languages from the same type of programming language, then it should be easier.
On wiki, there were 50 types of programming languages

P.S. I don’t have any money for lawyers.Hey! Not from Europe, but hope I have some helpful advice. In today’s day and age, a lot of being able to get a job depends on… wait for it, the power of networking. I am a student looking to start a blog, and I wanted to use these forums to gain experience. While stumbling upon online inspiration, I found a website.blog called Scientix that you can visit at http://www.scientix.eu/ 6. It’s basically and community for development in science in Europe. They have webinars, and a lot of other neat resources, that you can check out. Some tips I would recommend:

Get yourself an account on social media, and follow them, see what they’re language is like and what they like to post about.
Attend webinars and make your voice be heard, so they know who you are and you develop a mutual understanding
Communicate by email and ask if they have any internship locations
Finally,  see if you can start a project or initiate a movement that they would like. Talk to them about it, and see if you can base your internship off of that idea.
That’s all I got, hope it helped!
Hello @polen35,
I started a new website (https://faruse.com/ 8) just to put my learnings from Codecademy into action and experiment with different things. Also being an english speaker, language can be a barrier in Europe so I decided to put together all the jobs and internships available in EU. You can find different internships and jobs and always happy to connect to talk more about coding.
Thanks!I checked out your website, wow it’s really impressive. Love the initiative as well."
263,Guide: First Steps in Tackling a Group Project,Tips and Resources,1,1.4k,"
Codecademy Community FAQs on General Coding Questions.png1000×208 146 KB

This guide can be used to tackle other project ideas in a group setting.  This guide was itself written by a collaborative team, you can find our other guides here 5.
Step One – Understand the Project
Assess the prompt or project requirements.  What technical skillsets do you need to complete the assignment?  For example, will you need UI, UX, front- and back-end, and data analysis?  How advanced a skillset in each is required and how much work is there to go around?  From here you’ll know who else you need to find to work with and how many of them.  An in-depth understanding of the project and exactly what you need to do it can come later.
Understanding your project also means understanding what you’ll need from a team.  We have a whole guide on how software development teams work (here 3) that we recommend reading and will refer to below, but for the time being you can just read this quick article on who does what in a dev team to get started.  If you’re working on a simple project early on in your web development journey, you probably only need one teammate and a Multiplayer Repl 1 or Codepen collab.  If your project is more complex, you’ll need a more complex team structure too.  For most mid-sized projects that you may do while learning, four people is probably the right team size (read this 1 for more info), with one team lead who also codes, one UX/UI designer who also codes, someone on the front-end, and someone to cover the back-end.
Step One-Point-Five… If You’re Charting Your Own Path
Working on a project that isn’t predefined or prompted for you means that you’ll have to spend more time in step one, because you’ll need to find and define your idea and a whole lot else besides.  Read this 2 quick article for a helping hand.
If you’re working on a very complex idea in mind, like building a fully-functioning professional-quality app, you’ll need to spend even more time in the planning process.  This 2 long article is a really great resource for planning out that whole journey.  Don’t forget to research using the right stack 2.
You can and probably should do this planning with a team, but it can also be hard to gather a team of volunteers if you aren’t sure what you want and over what timeline.  One things that makes groups successful in more freeform projects like this is if they already know each other and ideally if they’ve already completed a project together before.  So, our advice is to start slowly and steadily with smaller projects tailored to your skill level, so that you can build up your experience and relationships before going for an ambitious project.
Step Two – Find Your Teammates
Find collaborators!  In the Pro Slack group, join and post in the #code-buddies channel to find other people looking to work on projects too.  If in doubt, know that the group moderators have all tackled group projects before, so feel free to ask questions.  If you aren’t in the Pro community or if you want to cast a wider net, you can also find collaborators here on the forums (post in #general), on the Facebook group 2, at local meetups, or in a whole host of other places.
Step Three – Build Your Team
Choose and assign roles.  One of you will need to be a project manager for the assignment, someone to keep an eye on component tasks and tie it all together.  This isn’t necessarily the most technically skilled member – in fact in the “real world” it’s often the opposite.  Know at this stage that roles ≠ tasks.
Step Four – Do Your Research
Do your research.  You all have some foundational work to do, all of which differs depending on your team roles.
Context For Everyone
First, everyone on the team who is coding should know about this 3 guide.  If your project is a very simple front-end website, you may be able to just work on a Codepen or Repl together and not use GitHub, but if you can use GitHub you should.  It is highly recommended that you follow the GitHub guide completely.  If you aren’t doing any coding in the team, e.g. if you’re covering UX only, you can go to the “skip steps” section.
Everyone should also watch this 1 video on how developer teams work.
Context for the Team Lead
Overview: The team lead should read this 3 guide to how teams work in order to have a good breadth of context and information.  Your team will be relying on you to organize them, and to a large extent you’ll educate them as you go on what you learn from that guide.  Pick the methodology to work with, e.g. Agile vs. Waterfall, Scrum vs. Kanban.  Give your other teammates the lowdown on how their work will go.  If you want to know some secrets of being a good team lead / manager where developers will love working with you, watch this 1.
Crash Course: The link above is a long guide, so if you’re eager to just start, want to just skip to helping your teammates set up in an Agile framework and “back fill” your knowledge from the above guide later, you can.  For the purposes of group projects, go for Kanban if you’re 1) relatively new to group projects 2) not very experienced with technologies 3) have a smaller project.  Alternatively go with Scrum if you’ve 1) done a small group project before 2) have some experience building projects.  Once you’ve picked Scrum or Kanban, watch this 1 on user stories, then these two resources on project and product management (roles that you’ll be doing in this team).  You should also skim through the articles available to you here.  After that, read/watch the following in this order in order to quickly set up in a Scrum system (1, 2, 3 4, 5) or a Kanban system (1 1, 2, 3, 4).
Context for the Designer
Designer – read our guide 1 on design.  You may be splitting your design team up between UX and other forms of design, in which case you can split this list accordingly.
Step Five – Organize
We’d recommend everyone on the team reading the below so they know more about why and how the project is being structured, but only the team lead needs to read the below.


Tracking:  Team lead should set up task tracking and reporting so everyone knows what work is being done by whom and how it all comes together.  I’d recommend using a Trello 2 board to track tasks as it’s simple and free.  See guides for using Trello with Scrum here and with Kanban here.  If you prefer another tool, like if you really want to get Jira experience before using it at work, that’s totally fine too.

Communication: You should all agree on where you should chat and check in!  You can start a private channel on the Pro Slack (easiest), open your own free Slack workspace, start a Discord server, whatever you’d like.

Time Commitments: Some people can commit a lot of time, some can’t.  Understand early what people can and should commit to for this project, when they will be online and working, and set expectations early.

Deadlines: It’s hard to do work without them.  Always remember that your teammates are volunteers, so it’s important to get everyone’s input and assent for deadlines, so that they agree to the things they’ll be held accountable for.  Read more about how to set deadlines the right way here.

Syncing: Make sure that you and your team agree to a regular schedule of checking in with one another and on the project.  Though most of these check-ins can be done asynchronously or via chat, you should try to meet on a group call when possible too.  You don’t have to have do it daily, but the standup framework should help you (read this for more info).

Product Specifications & Implementing User Stories: Your team can work together to figure out exactly what needs to be done in order to build your product based on user stories provided (if you’re doing your own project and need to make your user stories, read “extra credit” below).  Have a meeting and walk through the user stories, discussing what you’d need to do to make it happen.  You can also divide up those stories between people to research what it’ll take to complete them to save on meeting time.

Pull Requests and Merging: You’re all going to be working on different parts of the same project, and they’ll eventually all need to come together.  Decide on a system of pull requests, approvals, and merging.  For example, one contributor will ask to make a pull request, and then they’ll need to have at least one thumbs up from someone who has reviewed their PR before merging.  Make sure everyone is clear on how this system works and who approves what, when.

Group Learning: Finally, and this is vital, you’re all taking part in this project to learn with one another.  Even on the job as a professional, continued learning, mentorship, and education is a vital part of a developer’s work and job satisfaction.  Make sure that you’re taking the time to review one-another’s code not just for whether it should be merged or not, but how it can be better.  Take the time to walk each other through concepts – after all, studies show that this is one of the best ways to cement your learning (fact!).  Consider having one teammate do a screenshare of something tricky for the others.  Talk through things and overcommunicate.  If you all just work silently, you’ll only get a fraction of the value.  This doesn’t mean everyone leaning on the most skilled people in the group or expecting to be taught, talk about it among yourselves and set expectations.

Extra Credit:


User Stories: Some projects for learners will already come with a series of user stories that you need to work through.  If you are working on a project of your own, then you’ll need to make them.  User stories are part of the team lead and designer’s reading list, but multiple team members can and should be involved.  You can quickly learn how to craft your own user stories here.  Adding more user stories is another great way to build your skills and keep practicing without continually having to build projects from scratch.  You can easily just put yourself into the mind of the user and ask yourself… what would I as a consumer want from this website or software?  From there, the sky’s the limit.

Pointing or sizing: User stories have varying levels of complexity and may take different amounts of time to complete.  When development teams estimate the time and effort it will take to accomplish a task, it is usually called pointing or sizing.  This is important for being able to equitably divide work and to meet deadlines.  You can learn about how to size projects in this quick blog post, and it’s best to do this in a group conversation if possible as it will be a very productive way to reframe and apply what you’ve been learning in coding.

Step Six – Get to Work
Get to it!  Have a kick-off meeting, ideally on Skype or another video call system, so you can all meet one another and discuss the project.
Remember that if and when you get stuck, you can and should lean on each-other in order to get through problems.  In the real world, developers troubleshoot their own work first with tried and true methods, but they aren’t shy to ask teammates for help too.  If your teammates can’t help either, reach out here on the forums or in the Pro Slack community.
Sometimes, s**t happens.  Maybe a teammate has an emergency and needs to leave or just goes AWOL.  Everyone’s volunteering for these groups and has other things in life to do, and we should be understanding of this fact.  Even in the “real world” workplace, people get sick and things too.  If someone leaves your group and you need a replacement, post in the Pro Slack and the community will try to help you out.
Step Seven – Share!
Post your project in #project-feedback and share it with the other Pro learners on Slack!  Getting feedback is a vital part of the development process and in growing your skills.  Remember to give back to other people wanting feedback or guidance, not just because it’s a good thing to do but because you’ll benefit yourself when other people are there to help you too.
If you’re feeling generous, don’t just share your work but share your insights and guidance for the next team tackling something similar.  Paying it forward and giving back is how the developer world works – entire languages have been built this way.Very informative guide, thank you!

264,Back-end vs Front-end: Where should I start?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,630,"Hi!
I am considering starting a new skill path and am hesitating between the ‘Create a Front-end app with React’ and the ‘Create a Back-end App with JavaScript’ paths. I will follow both anyway but need to pick one to start. No previous experience except Python/Data Science.
Which one would you start with?
Thanks!Suggest start with JavaScript core language before embarking upon React or Node.js. This will give you the foundation needed for both.
Front-end is serverless so confines itself to what can be run in the user agent (browser).
With your knowledge of Python, you could leverage it in a back-end Django environment, but you still need to have a good understanding of the HTML and CSS since you are essentially generating response documents from data and templates on the server.For back-end, you can start to learn first JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular Js, React and many more.
For Front - End javascript, HTML, CSS and photoshop is enough. For more career growth back end is more important."

269,How about generic Advanced Python Course?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,84,"After you learned the basics from “Learn Python 3”, like syntax, data structures, functions, and classes, and instead of diving into specializations like web apps or data science, you want to master the language itself. I’d really like to complete something like “Learn Advanced Python”.
Some suggestions from stack overflow:

decorators/closures
generators
list comprehensions
map, filter, and lambda
metaprogramming
concurrency
multithreading vs multiprocessing
mutex
regex
protocols
PDB
Unit testing
continuous integration

All this probably scattered all over other courses, but I’d love to have some of it in one place. It also seems like great real-life skills.As you say at least some of the things you mentioned are nestled away in various sections but they’re often very short introductions. Personally I’d be very happy for more Python courses but sticking in every possibility of the language might be a bit of an ask, especially since several of those points aren’t limited to Python.
If you come across others on CC then compiling a list of the possibilities would be helpful for anyone else in the future .
As a potentially useful aside if I’m not mistaken the O’Reilly “Python Cookbook” covers the majority of those points as would similar slightly more intermediate/advanced texts on Python.
There are some brief lessons on list comprehensions in learn python3, nestled in the loops section - https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-loops/
Map, filter and lambda are arguably more important for Python 2 (and you can find a few lessons that use them in the Python 2 course) but they are only covered briefly again-
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python/lessons/advanced-topics-in-python/exercises/lambda-expressions
I think the natural language processing section is Python based and would inevitably use general regular expressions and I would assume also make use of Python’s re module (I have only done part of it so that may not be entirely correct)-
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/natural-language-processingThank you for detailed reply! I heard about O’Reilly “Python Cookbook”, and also theirs “Fluent Python”. I’m definitely going to read it, but I enjoy Codecademy’s format and hope one of these books will become a course one day."
270,[Article] Planning your programming project,Featured Challenges and Events,0,967,"Once you select your project, you will want to plan out how to approach it. This planning phase will be enormously helpful to you as you go along. Think of it like writing an outline for an essay before you write the actual essay. Plan out your code by using your algorithmic thinking skills and breaking down each part of your program into specific functions, and then write the code for each of those functions. Take a look at this sample plan from Code Conquest:
“For example, a translation game would require the following functions: a function to add a word and its translation to their respective arrays a function to call function 1 on each word a function to load a word onto the screen a function to fire when the user’s input is correct a function to fire when the user’s input is incorrect a function to determine whether to fire function 4 or function 5” Then, you can write each function separately and better schedule how long it will take to write the entire program.

It takes time to learn a language, and everyone’s time to get baseline concepts varies greatly.
Often the common key is consistent practice. It can be 20-30 minutes a day. If it’s honest, thoughtful practice, over time you will find you have a base of knowledge that you can act upon.
I often think of it like gardening or farming in the sense that from one day to the next, it’s hard at first to appreciate the progress made. But an experienced gardener knows that setting the right foundations and doing the daily upkeep goes a long way to creating something that lasts over time.thank you, i am just worried cause i have been like this for a month and a half and i only have 3 months to learn python on codecademy cause they were giving away pro so i want to learn as much as possible cause i dont want to miss out on the 3 months pro, and i want to create an aiYea don’t rush it. There’s plenty of (free) material out there after you’ve done pro so don’t feel like there’s a time limit.thanks bro, i really appreciate your feedbackYour surely not dumb.Everyone can learn a language if they try enough.
I hope you do it.If you wanna learn coding then you need to understand two thing, Computer Logic and Computer Grammar.
Computer Logic is like “Start Program > Read Declaration > First Question > First Answer > Is Job Completed? > Yes = Done, No = Repeat.”
Computer Grammar is like how you speak, but instead talk to people, we talk via keyboard. (Like when trying to arrange this messages in my brain with English.)
To speed up your Computer Grammar, try to speak up or maybe humming it, it’s will be easier than remembering every word on dictionary.No one’s ‘‘too dumb’’ for anything. I’m even trying to learn French and I’m already improving in it.Yea for sure bro! Don’t worry and don’t be shy to retake some exercises!
I’m currently learning C# and some parts are really hard so i retake them a few times to understand it and also read out loud so you can hear yourself.I’m getting the hang of the basics and I think I’m good at them like I can make a simple text-based game or a scripted bot, but nothing more, it makes me feel bad when I can understand something and my 3 months are almost overthanks mate, i just have low self-esteemyeah maybe it has to do with me reading fast cause i only have 3 months pro, and i have been trying to learn python as quick as i canI’m 45 days straight into the Comp Sci path coding from 1 to 8 hours a day and I’m on my fourth reset. Learning anything takes time and I’m often extremely frustrated but I’ve rebooted my career at least four times and each time the first year is very difficult but after that it get’s easier. My current goal is to code everyday until I feel i got it. I’m thinking two to three years. LOL■■■■ you are really dedicated I get frustrated easily too I’ve taken a break for a while nowNow I’m up to 63 days, the things with learning is not to let your expectations overwhelm the reality of the situation. It takes time to learn and we all learn at different paces. I think the key is to be patient with yourself. There is no rush."
276,Setting Up Conda in Git Bash,Tips and Resources,2,1.6k,"Setting Up Conda in Git Bash
If you’re a Windows user following along with the Data Science or Computer Science career paths on Codecademy (or the Learn Python courses), you may have noticed the recommendation to use Git Bash 5 for your terminal, and the instructions on installing Python via Miniconda 3, but the lack of guidance on using conda within the Git Bash terminal rather than CMD or Anaconda Prompt.
If you use and enjoy Git Bash and want to take advantage of the power of conda without switching terminals, follow the instructions below to get it up and running.
(This post assumes you have already installed and used Git Bash previously)
What is conda, and why would I want to use it?
Before we dive into the instructions, it’s important to understand a little about conda and how it differs from pip.  In short, conda is a very powerful package manager that excels at managing dependencies and offers an easy way to create and use virtual environments for your projects.  It is used primarily in the Data Science world, but can be used for much, much more.
For a detailed breakdown, read the excellent post by Jake VanderPlas (Software Engineer, Google), Conda: Myths and Misconceptions 3
Instructions
1. Install Anaconda
Although Codecademy recommends  installing Miniconda, I highly recommend saving some headaches and installing the full version of Anaconda if you have the space on your PC and you are serious about getting into Data Analysis/Data Science.  Miniconda is a barebones version of the Anaconda distribution, and is a little less beginner-friendly, coming with only Python, conda, pip, and a couple of dependencies necessary to make them work.
If you are low on hard drive space, Miniconda is fine — just don’t be surprised by the number of packages you’ll have to install that would be ready out of the box with Anaconda (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter, Scikit-learn, etc.).
You can download the installer for Anaconda here 13.
2. Run Anaconda Prompt (skip this section if you are familiar with conda)
Once Anaconda is downloaded and installed, you will be ready to use conda.  Before we set it up in Git Bash, it is useful to see what it looks like when you are using conda.
Anaconda and Miniconda come with a program called Anaconda Prompt on Windows, which is essentially just CMD terminal that is pre-set-up for conda.  If you type Anaconda in your Windows search bar, you will see Anaconda Prompt come up.  Click on it to use conda for the first time:
image782×641 38.7 KB
Once you open it up, you will see something like this:
image1102×634 17 KB
Notice that at the beginning of the prompt, you  see (base).  This tells you that you are currently inside of the conda virtual environment called base.  This base environment is where all of the pre-loaded packages are contained.  Later on, as you become more familiar with conda, you should begin creating new environments for each project you work on.  When you do, you will see the name of the currently active conda environment inside of the parentheses.  For example, if you make and activate an environment called “test”, you will see (test) at the beginning of the prompt.
If you are interested in seeing which packages are installed in your base environment, simply type the command conda list.
3. Make conda run in Git Bash
A) Open Git Bash
Now that you have an idea of how conda should look, go ahead and open Git Bash.  As you can see, there is nothing on the prompt to indicate whether you are inside an active conda environment or not.  Unfortunately, it’s not quite that simple.  If you type conda list in Git Bash, you will receive an error that looks something like this:
bash: conda: command not found

This is because conda has only been set up to run from Anaconda Prompt by default.
B) Add the conda shell script to your .bashrc
In order to make the conda command available in Git Bash, you need to add conda’s shell script to your .bashrc file.  This is the same file that you store your bash aliases in (such as the sqlite3 alias you probably created when you followed these instructions 46).
The shell script we need is located inside of the folder your Anaconda distribution added to your computer.  If you remember where that is, you can navigate there using the File Explorer.  If you don’t remember, the easiest way to find it is to use the search bar and search for “Anaconda3” and scroll down to the folders:
image783×639 41.3 KB
Open this folder, then navigate to etc -> profile.d.
Inside of the profile.d folder, you should see a file called conda.sh.  This is the file you want to add to your .bashrc file.
Now, there are a few ways you can do this: a) you can open your .bashrc and type it in there; b) you can type the path to conda.sh in Git Bash and add it to your .bashrc from there; or c) you can open Git Bash in the profile.d folder and utilize the bash command PWD in order to lower the risk of spelling errors in the path.  The last option is my preferred choice, so that is what I will cover here.
Go ahead and close Git Bash, and then right click inside the file explorer and choose “Git Bash Here”:
image692×497 22 KB
This will open a new instance of Git Bash to the correct directory.
Now, so long as the path to your file has no spaces, you can add conda.sh to your .bashrc with this simple command:
echo "". ${PWD}/conda.sh"" >> ~/.bashrc

If the path does contain spaces (such as in your username), you will need to add single quotes in the command like so:
echo "". '${PWD}'/conda.sh"" >> ~/.bashrc

After running this command, you will need to close Git Bash and reopen it for it to take effect.
C) Reopen Git Bash and activate conda!
When you reopen Git Bash, you still won’t see (base) in your prompt — that’s because you haven’t activated conda yet!  To activate it, simply type the command conda activate and hit Enter.  You should see (base) pop up above your prompt:

And that’s it!  You’ve successfully enabled conda in your Git Bash terminal.  Now Git Bash can do virtually everything Anaconda Prompt can do, just make sure to use the conda activate command whenever you want to use conda in a new Git Bash window (you  can also use conda deactivate if you want to exit your conda environment and use a different installation of Python).
Thanks for reading, and happy coding!Hi coco, sorry for the delay I needed a break.
Consider myself a total noobie in this maters so I am not entierly sure what is going on while following some of this instructions, neither I knew Python was already bundled with Anaconda…
Long story short, I have probably messed up somewhere so I uninstalled EVERYTHING, Anaconda, Python even VS code just in case 
Then I followed every step on your guide and now it works perfectly! 
I am going to delete my previous post to aviod confussions.
I still have some doubts though, with this setup I dont need to add anything else to the path?
Neither python?
My apollogies, and thank you for your time!All good @kennyx0r , I’m glad you got it working!
I was mostly concerned that you (or anyone else reading through) would get even more confused by the alternate method you were using.  I remember exactly what it was like being a new to programming and trying to set up everything on my own device for the first time.  That’s precisely why I wrote this post — to save others the agony that I had to go through! 
As far as adding Python to your path, you probably won’t need to so long as you are only using Anaconda Prompt or Git Bash (with conda activated).  I don’t remember for sure, but Anaconda may give you the option to automatically add it to your path while installing.  If not, you’ve already shown that you know how to do so if the need arises (just add the python.exe file to the PATH variable in your system environment variables).  If you later decide to download another version of Python from python.org, that installer also asks if you want to add it to your PATH variable, so you can do it with just a click of a button.
Now, if VS Code doesn’t recognize your version of Python, you may have to add the path to that python.exe file inside of VS Code itself.  This can easily be done inside the VS Code settings.  Just search the settings for “python path” and enter the path in this section:

Hopefully this helps get you all set up!  If not, feel free to post any other questions here in the forums.
Happy coding!"

The course completion certificates aren’t meant to be viewed in the same way as one might an AWS Developer certification, for example 1, because the Codecademy course - and ultimately your work throughout it - is not proctored nor rigorously examined. You can, throughout, simply ask for the solution and arrive at the same result.
Rather, they’re meant as proof that you have completed a course - so they’re more like a CPD* or training proof than a standardized “qualification” cert like you can obtain by passing an exam.
The certificate does have a QR code, which links back to your Codecademy profile, to allow anyone to whom you submit the certificate the ability to “validate” it… but that’s about as far as it goes. Profile>View Certificate>Add to LinkedIn Profile>Copy the Link"

The guys over at DigitalOcean are hosting the awesome Hacktoberfest again and that can only mean one thing: a chance to win the free t-shirt! Just kidding (or am I?), the main benefit of Hacktoberfest is to make it as easy, painless and accessible as possible for new developers to contribute to open source projects on GitHub.
If you are learning a language and have the goal of being a professional dev, I’m sure you’ve heard of GitHub. However, it might feel daunting or even scary to contribute to an open project. After all, if you are a newbie like me, you might be thinking “Am I good enough?”, “Do I actually know what I am doing?” and the classic “I probably don’t know enough to contribute anything meaningful”.
So! Hacktoberfest is our opportunity to find beginner-friendly maintainers and repos that have already accepted that we aren’t seasoned devs, and are still willing to hear us out (read our code) and give us a chance. You know how exciting it is to see your code pull request go online, reviewed and accepted? It’s an amazing feeling, trust me. So let’s get to it.

I already learned Python by my own during quarantine before I started attending CodeAcademy’s courses, and I am sure I master the basics of it. So, I would like to be able to skip some of the Python lessons (and have them marked as completed as well) without having to review and complete it step by step. Is there such option? If not, I would like to suggest some kind of skill tests to check our proficiency, which could allow us to skip some steps we already know
Thanks  I’m sure one could easily complete the Python course, however, and I wouldn’t recommend this, you could just press solution to every lesson, until you come to a lesson you want to do.

I believe they don’t do this as the certificates aren’t recognised anywhere-they’re more for personal use.

288,Reflection on a 35 Day Streak,30-Day Challenge,2,607," Reflection on a 35 Day Streak 
The Beginning of the Beginner
 Many years ago in high school I had taken a Web Design course and absolutely loved it. HTML & CSS were my jam and it was a class I always looked forward to. It never occurred to me to truly think about pursuing those skills further. I knew I liked what I was doing, but no one really talked about jobs as a developer. 
Fast forward going to college and getting both my bachelors and masters degrees I always kept the love for HTML & CSS close by, but career-wise ended up in Higher Education. I found ways to incorporate these skills into course design, projects and web updates for our organization website. I absolutely love what I do professionally, but I wanted to find a way to legitimize my skill sets and truly learn the foundation of coding.
*Enter Pandemic* *Enter Codecademy* 
  March 2019  was the last hint of what use to be our normal. Having to worry about quarantine and navigating a whole new lifestyle was a challenge to say the least. I ended up being very lucky to have the ability to work from home. With the extra time I gained back from commuting to and from work I knew it was the perfect time to explore taking classes in coding. I did some investigative searching on Google for the best courses or programs and Codecadmy was one of the first to pop up. I had never had any experience with coding bootcamps, courses or programs so I figured I would take some time to test it out. Within the first 10 minutes of the Learn HTML course I was hooked and was on to the Pro membership. I loved the style of how the lessons were set up, the projects, the practice options. It all made sense to me and I was having so much fun.  
I soon learned about the Group Focus sessions with Lil and found that to be a great way to stay on track with my goal of hitting the 30 day streak. It was also great to meet others who  have a love for coding. While I am truly just a beginner, it was insightful to hear about the more advanced level projects that others were working on and to see that there were others like me who were just starting out. The forums also became a guiding source for how to navigate challenge projects, learning about GitHub and navigating the ins and outs of coding basics. 
35 Days of Coding - What It Looked Like For Me  
As you can tell from the title I had achieved my goal for the 30 day streak and actually went on to make it 35 days. Here are my takeaways from this experience: 


While initially I had started with a Skill Path, I found that because I was focused on building a solid foundation first,  the individual courses were how I decided to tackle my learning. I started with Learn HTML then Learn CSS and Learn Color Design.(I personally love Color Theory)  


Since I work full-time, I had to be strategic about planning for time to code.  I would choose 2-3 days a week (typically weekends and late evenings) where I would focus on completing multiple lessons and then the remainder of the week I would do the practice packs in the app version of Codecademy on my phone or iPad.  This was great to help reinforce content I had learned.


I found it was always best to complete a lesson and try not to leave it partially completed. Mostly due to the fact that it would sometimes be hard to pick up where I left off. It was easier to start fresh with a new lesson.


Don’t forget about the Challenge Projects! (List of Challenge Projects 17) I went all the way through the Learn HTML course and almost all of  Learn CSS before doing one of the challenge projects and I wish I had tackled them sooner. It’s a great way to make sure you fully understand the concept and can put them to practice. 


Cheatsheets are awesome! For many of the lessons you’ll see there is a link for a cheatsheet. For some, I actually printed out the cheatsheets and then used that to also take notes on the side while I was going through a lesson. If you’re a visual learner, I highly recommend doing that if possible. 


Spelling and spacing is way more important than I ever realized. I’m sure every beginner in coding has said this, but I ran into many occasions where my code was perfectly fine, but I was missing a letter in a word or a space or a wrong bracket. Sometimes it really can be that simple so take your time and don’t rush, it literally could mean the difference from well executed code and wracking your brain forever trying to figure out what went wrong. 


 Final Thoughts 
Overall, my experience has been really positive and fulfilling. I’ve gotten to start the journey of sharpening my skills, connect with people who are also interested in coding and get into a groove of making coding a regular part of my schedule. This is only the beginning and I am truly looking forward to learning so much more. With the skills I learn, I hope to continue infusing them into my current full-time role and work on projects of my own. For anyone just starting out, Codecademy is a great place to call home and get started.

Happy Coding,
Ella This is great @efeliciano515!  Maybe you can share this on Medium or Dev.to 4… just a thought in case you didn’t already have that in mind 
I really like the Group Focus sessions with @lilybird too. It was actually the focus session from Wednesday last week that led me to your post here  I hope to make it to another session soon (maybe next week since it’s a bit hectic for me this week).
Thanks for including the link to the Challenge Projects. I bookmarked that for future reference  I’ve also bookmarked cheatsheets & downloaded a similar resource called reference guides as well. Those have definitely come in handy as I was working through the SQL projects in the Data Science Career Path I’ve been following.
What you said about spelling & spacing in coding is very true. I hate when I forget to end my code with a semi-colon  It’s amazing how missing a single character like that can cause an error in your output.
I totally agree with you that Codecademy is an excellent starting point. They offer a broad selection of courses along with opportunities to connect with others @webdevholland Thank you so much for your response! Glad this could be helpful. I will definitely look into Medium or Dev.to. I hadn’t considered those options. Thanks again and looking forward to connecting in a future focus session this month!"
289,What’s your goal?,Learn From Home Club,5,119,"You don’t start something without a pre-defined goal.

I originally wanted to do web dev…now I’m flirting with cybersecurity. Right now learning to code is more like a hobby that I will get back to…like learning Russian…and learning to play piano…and some other thing I was trying to learn that I probably forgot about…
Ugh, does anybody have tips on how to manage three different classes in a week when you only have an hour in the early morning five days a week…and you’re barely functional in the mornings?"
290,Feature request (or rather wish): React / Firebase,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,106,"First things first: I’m really happy that you now have a tutorial about Hooks in your React course. I was a bit disappointed that I had to learn it somewhere else (big thanks to Codevolution).
My suggestion now is: Add a Firebase tutorial to the React course. Why? I’m an absolute beginner with React and I was missing a real success moment at the end of the ‘old’ course.
While I learned about Hooks somewhere else, I also learned about Googles Firebase while creating an Instagram clone. And it gave me that moment of success you and I need at the beginning of a journey.
I know that using Firebase as some disadvantages, mainly that you heavily depend on Google. But it has some pros to take into consideration like:

The basic version is free of charge. This is nice for small projects.
Simple implementation of different types of authentication (e.g. email / password, social login)
Easy to use data base. And it is easy to learn to deal with a real time db.
Really nice way to learn how to secure your app and how to deal with rules based access.
Fast publishing of the own app.
And if your app idea is worth a billion, Firebase scales up as you need it.

Later on it absolutely makes sense to learn to code all of  that on you own (express, sql db, routes, api access, axios etc. ). But for a “cotton candy cloud good feel” start with the first app Firebase is a way to go.Hey @uranwolle, thanks for this. I’m welcoming of feedback in general, but feedback this well-constructed makes it easy to consider.  I’ve passed it along to our curriculum team members. Hey @uranwolle! Lead author on the React updates here. Thanks for the feedback! I totally agree that the “cotton candy cloud good feel” is valuable and nice to have as early as possible 
It sounds like you’re looking to build a React app that includes…

authentication/access control
database
security
…and Firebase happens to cover all of those features.

We don’t cover Firebase, but we do have content to make something equivalent. The soon-to-be released Full-Stack Career Path will have you building apps with all of this. It will replace the current Web Development Career Path.
Until that release, the Ravenous and Jammming projects in the Web Dev Career Path are good practice for React. They work with external APIs, which touches on a few of the concepts you’re interested in.Hey @alyssavigil and @nduckwiler
Thank you for your quick reply and you feedback. It is right that you already have covered these topics with the Ravenous and Jamming projects. These both projects are already very good to learn important topics like authentication, accessing a public API, accessing a data base, processing the response and so on. I have no intention to suggest a replacement. But for me as a beginner it was very difficult to deal with both of these projects and I had to learn it elsewhere to fully understand the covered topic. This is no critic since I know that I’m a rather slow learner.
But I dare to say that I’m not alone with it and maybe you put it on your bucket list for the bucket list. Working with Firebase and also AWS Amplify gives you a quick success feeling. The syntax is relatively simple but it covers all topics that I mentioned in my first post.
I also think that both solutions take away a lot of pain from the development of apps (authentication and data base access will never be fun) and will therefor become more and more important and popular.  But this is just my personal opinion / feeling.
Again, thank you for you feedback and that you took the time for the replies.
I’m looking forward to your Full-Stack Career Path! "

Feel free to elaborate below.I’m addicted to TikTok and I’m trying to stop  You can go hours scrolling through it and I’m procrastinating heavily. I just want to delete it, but I can’t. Trying to slowly hype myself up to do it though.I’m on discord everyday other than that I can’t handle the constant input.@h1lo
OMGGGG… I AGREE WITH YOU 100% 
for that reason, I haven’t downloaded the app… I only use it on my friend’s phone…
It’s so addicting…
Before TikTok, I didn’t know that seeing people doing stupid things is so entertaining!Does this count as social media?I was wondering if anyone would raise that question.  I would say educational/technical ‘forums’ are not social media but I could argue either way 
It depends on the purpose for being on the forum.  Girl, same here, but with Instagram instead 
But to be honest, I think I’m improving 
I recently took a whole freaking week break from social media, and it was very helpful lol.



 cloudvity1020:

I didn’t know that seeing people doing stupid things is so entertaining!


Couldn’t had said it better  


 thepitycoder:

Does this count as social media?


I’m going to guess yes? haha, since there is people are you are consuming content? Hmm… interesting question though.
I answered “extensively” because I check all sorts of online platforms regularly, including (but not limited to): DEV.to, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Slack.
I’ll give a word of caution to people trying to “network” online when learning to code: be honest to yourself. It’s so easy to go down the rabbit hole and end up with 50 tutorials on Python or amazing front-end web dev, machine learning algorithms, the top 10 things every beginners should know, and the “this is how I got my first job in tech”. Don’t waste your time. I’m sure there is some useful info in those articles, but don’t let them be your main focus.
Ever heard of busy buffering? It’s when we start doing tasks that keep us from doing the things we should actually be doing. It gives us a sense of “I’m working on something” while not actually moving forward. Don’t buffer in social media, even tech social media.
PS: I busy buffer all the time, that’s why I’m warning you Oh, I would say I’ve been down many rabbit holes and the payoff isn’t worth it most of the time.   
Don’t we all busy buffer because there is always something better than working on something we should be doing.  "

296,What life values has coding taught you?,Random,6,217,"Hey everyone!
I’ve always believed everything we do teaches us a different value we can apply in many areas of our lives.
For example, art has taught me to not be afraid of failure, and not giving up before even trying.
But I want to know what coding has taught you guys!
To me, it has taught me to deal with frustration. After frustration, always comes success, so if you ever face frustration, don’t go nuts! Take a break, a time to do something else and don’t think about your problem. (Although your brain will be coming up with a solution even while you don’t realize it). Then you can come back to your problem with a fresh pair of eyes and a new perspective, and realizing where your error is will be much easier. So never give up! But don’t let frustration take over you either.
How about you? @yizuhi hi, coding has taught me to believe in myself and to keep going on… Side effects do include high levels of frustration.  …lol  just kidding 
Edit thanks for the like @yizuhiOoh yes perseverance  Such a valuable life skill (well skill isn’t exactly the word I’m looking for but you know what I mean ) And yeaaaah…frustration. It either kills you or makes you lol Wow, I’ve never really considered coding to be something that teaches you life values, man,t hat’s deep. But if coding has taught me anything, it’s that anything is possible. The advancement of technology may seem new to us, but we have all the resources we need, nobody has just been able to put them together in a way that is different, or conveniences us in a different way. Was really insightful and eye-opening, loved it! Yeah, my Dad taught me that basically everything we do can teach us something, and the way we do things says a lot about ourselves.



 giga2095771915:

But if coding has taught me anything, it’s that anything is possible.


Definitely, the only limit is, really, our imagination 
Glad you liked it Hii @yizuhi
coding has taught me some valuable lessons as well:


Patience
Before I started coding, I was actually an impatient person… as I started, that began to change… I found myself thinking optimistically and encouraging myself to try harder

Perseverance
I was always a person who never gave up, but coding has taught me the importance of perseverance. I think that it is a very important trait for coders

Problem-solving
Coding requires coming up with solutions to various problems. It also exercises the brain and allows me to think outside the box

That’s all I can think of now…
Byee~~
Honestly, this one’s a bit of a tricky one for me. I’m homeschooled in a country where I don’t speak the language, so most of my time is spent at my desk. I’ve been a computer geek for as long as I can remember but I never really did anything about it. Never looked into my interest or tried to learn more about it. I instead focused on things like mechanical engineering or navigation at sea. I now realise it was really just because I wanted to be thought of as someone who can work with their hands instead of someone who just sits at a desk all day. I now realise that if I’m good with computers and I have an interest in it, I might as well stick to it. So I guess coding made me realise that I shouldn’t pretend to be someone I’m not and that I should just stick to what I like."

I don’t think there’s a single correct answer to that question.
What I would advise that you do would be to look at job boards and recruitment ads for where you live, or the areas you’d consider working in, and see what they’re asking for.

Depending on where you live,  what you are interested in, and your age, you have many options.
For example, if you are studying, you should look for companies where you live that offer internships. Or at the bare minimum, try to reach out on social media to engineers of those companies and see if they can help you with any tips or information.
If you are already working and looking for a career change, the network is still important and could open a lot of doors. Find online meetups and workshops (a lot of them are free) to build relationships, you’ll be surprised how friendly people can be. They could point you in the right direction of things to learn and focus on to make it to roles similar to theirs.
Another idea is to go to job sites, search for the sort of job you’d like, and taking notes on the requirements and skills these jobs have. Find what’s common in all of them, and learn those skills first.
Last but not least, work on your portfolio. No matter what you want to do or where, most certainly everyone will recommend you to work on personal projects and to get contribute to open-source projects. So get a head start and find things you want to build and build them! That will show initiative, self-organization, capacity to learn, and skill. All good things to showcase when trying to get a job Thanks a lot, that really helped"
301,Support Group for Data Analysts,Random,2,197,"Hey there, I am on track to complete CA’s “Data Scientist” course and am loving it so far. I actually just accepted my first analyst role last Friday. It’s a big deal because my background is no college, joined the Army, only have had customer service experience, am only 20 and am now the Ops Analyst for a small team that impacts the company in HUGE ways (handling executive partner accounts and finances, so my company and team literally depend on me to help increase year over year revenue.)
So, any who, I’ve been struggling to find a “support” group where I can talk to other data nerds for help and ideas. Especially one with females, but could care less about that.

302,Dark mode,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,216,"Hiya!
I’ve been using Codecademy for a couple of months now and it’s been a great experience so far!
However, there is one thing that could improve my experience by a great deal and that would be a dark mode.
I’ve got quite a lot of “floaters” (mouches volantes) in my eyes and they are making it hard for me to read text that has a very bright background. In some exercises, both the “Learn” and the “localhost” window show up on the screen and both are very, very bright and therefore hard to read for me. Apart from a browser plugin (which does a so-so job) I have found no way to change that.
So it would be fantastic if you could implement maybe a little switch next to the avatar or maybe even somewhere in the settings that changes the background- and text-color to something more easy on the eyes, I think that might help a lot of people, not just me.
Thanks and greetings

Great suggestion –– a dark mode would be great! I will pass along your request to our Product team.

Hey there,
You might want to read this: https://tech.ebayinc.com/engineering/how-we-built-ebays-first-node-js-application/ 2
Their prime concern was obviously scalability, which you shouldn’t really take into account when getting started with your project (you can worry about this later, if your project takes off).



 abdullae:

which languages are preferable to use in the backend


Do you already know one or several languages? If yes, I’d go with those. They started with Java and then revamped the app to use JavaScript. Either of those could work for you. But so would Python, Ruby, PHP, C#… any one of these could do the job. I’d personally use PHP because that’s what I know best, doesn’t mean it’s necessarily the best option, but it would work. As would any of the others.
For the frontend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
For cloud hosting, I’d look at DigitalOcean, AWS, Vultr… something like that.
As regards outsourcing or not, it really depends on your resources. This kind of job wouldn’t come cheap. You’d learn a great deal developing this yourself, but it’ll probably take you more time. Since you’re considering outsourcing, I can assume that your main goal is to make this a business, rather than a project for learning purposes. You could either try to find yourself a partner (CTO) to build this business with you, or outsource the job to a freelancer (UpWork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, Toptal).
Before spending considerable amounts, consider your value prop, as your competitors would be eBay, Amazon, Etsy, eBid, etc. That’s no small feat, competing in this market.
Best of luck!You’re not going to get the answers you’re looking for here. Why? Because a project of this magnitude requires a lot of planning as well as a good project manager, especially when you’re asking about doing things fast. The desire or need to have something done fast is the biggest downfall of any project. We don’t know what you’re after, we don’t know your skills, it could be simple or it could be very complex.
No one can tell you how much it’s going to cost unless you have a detailed project outlined, even then things always change and you need to account for a variance.
The answers you want require a lot of discussion with an experienced project manager, it takes time and most likely won’t be free.If you want it fast, and you want it now… I would:

Make sure you have you Employer Identification Number (EIN) and bank account info ready.
Create a Squarespace site

Set up Shopify Payments

Integrate Shopify in your Squarespace site (like this)

Good luck! 
PS: like others above said, ecommerce is no joke. My steps are to just have a place to take payments from customers. If you want to set up a broad marketplace for users to buy and sell like Ebay, then you are way out of scope, sorry (unless you are the founder of a startup and have others with you? Maybe then)thank you very much for replying, I am comfortable with mern stack, so what do you think if I go with that . And about cloud hosting how about Heroku, do you think it is good for big project? I wanna start this project slow with little functionality and then upgrade as time goes. And my main goal is business for sure. And what is CTO?
Regarding competition from ebay, amazon I don’t think there will be that much competition because my country’s payment system, delivery system and so many things are complicated and backward so I dont think they will be interested in the moment at least. Thats  the reason i thought about this project. I just wanted a general guide and what to expect. Well that was quite a lot of helpful information. I want to thank you Again for spending your precious time to review and answer my question in a very good way, it was so helpful, .


 abdullae:

I am comfortable with mern stack


If this is what you know best, use that  besides, it’ll do the job



 abdullae:

how about Heroku, do you think it is good for big project?


It doesn’t really matter right now IMO. You can always adapt/change later, depending on what the project needs. The most important thing, for now, is for you to come up with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), that will act as proof-of-concept. The environment the project lives on might change completely, someday. The stack, the hosting… don’t bother yourself too much with those, simply focus on making your vision a reality. But this is just my humble opinion. The idea is just to get started.



 abdullae:

And what is CTO?


Chief Technology/Technical Officer. Usually the guy in charge of determining the tech infrastructure of the company, and how it should evolve for future business needs. For now this would be you.



 abdullae:

so many things are complicated and backward […]. Thats the reason i thought about this project.


That’s usually how great things start. You wanna fix something that’s broken. I can only support this 100%.



 abdullae:

it was so helpful


Glad I could help   and again, best of luck with your project!Thank you, your answer that is more than enough, best of luck for you too."

Employers that expect you to walk onto the job with your own hardware better be prepared to rent it. What you are able to generate from your own user station is another thing, altogether. Keep in mind, your station, your content. The minute you carry your device onto the employer’s campus, they have a right to audit it. It’d be a cold day in H before I would take my device into such an environment. Leave your phone and your laptop at home, or deposit it at the entrance and pick it up on your way home.That doesn’t really answer his question. Yes, if the employer asks you to use your own equipment, they should pay more for your services.
It depends on the application being coded. As a reference, I use my own laptop at work because I work remotely and it was specified in the job application. I have a Macbook Pro with a 2.9GHz i7, 512GB SSD, and 16GB RAM. This is what is running constantly on my laptop:

Docker (running 8 different containers)
VSCode
Slack
Atom
7 terminal windows (from here I run the Angular UI and Node API)
2 different Chrome instances, at least 6 tabs open on each, sometimes more
Zoom for meetings
Gitkraken
Activity Monitor
Mail
DBeaver
Spotify

My RAM usually hovers at 90%, I keep Activity Monitor open to see what I have available. Sometimes the RAM gets to 98% and I have to close something. What uses the most resources:

Docker
Chrome
VSCode

I have no resources left to run the Kubernetes piece, all of that is in AWS. Some applications will not be this complex, you’ll never know what is required unless the company is very organized (I’ve never seen a company that is truly organized).
I really want to get the new Macbook Pro with 64GB of RAM, but I also don’t want to spend that money. As an alternative, we’re creating namespaces in AWS so each dev can have their environment there. You can connect VSCode to the containers so you can run the code there instead of locally.
Bottom line: it is a good idea to have 32GB of RAM. You also need to consider the projects you’ll be working on on your own. Docker is very useful to run a lot of different services, but it can use a lot of resources.

8GB: don’t even think about it, unless all you do is Wordpess sites
16GB: you can make it work
32GB: ideal
64GB: perfect
late reply but thanks for the help, answered my question. Stuck with the 16gb not worth the trouble."
306,What was your win this week?,Random,5,173,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not!

Did you finish a skill path or module?
Did you push some code to Github?
Did you review someone else’s code and provide constructive feedback?

Excited to hear about everyone’s win(s)! Lately I feel like I’m not making much progress. While I have a 111 day coding streak, I have found that I’m revisiting some already completed modules in order to gain better understanding of them so I can continue to move forward. I guess it’s a win if I understand more though! 
Non code-related: I continued to put some effort into cooking and made up a few recipes. I guess that’s a win b/c who wants to eat salad all the time? Ah congratulations, slow progress is still progress especially if it’s as consistent as a 111 day streak  Glad I’m not the only one though, it has felt like a really slow week for achievement. I’ve been fighting with drivers and doing some basic changes to my workspace; necessary I suppose but it sure feels uphill.
Getting stuck always prompts me to do other things though so cooking has been pretty decent too. Far too cold for salads now (or so my taste buds tell me) so there’s a little more spice in things at the minute; that definitely works for me.Two wins this week:


Finally getting a huge project at work over the line and delivered, albeit a bit late thanks to overruns beyond my control ('rona).


Making a successful foray into home brewing… 

Oh man, for a moment I forgot it was Friday already 
Coding related, this week I decided that after I’m done with an important coding project I have, I will take a break from coding. And how is that a win? Well I think it’s better to face the fact that I got a bit sick of coding instead of trying to fool myself. A break will recharge my motivation again (hopefully lol) 
Non coding-related, I started to get back into drawing finished illustrations (no more WIPs hanging around my desk). Also Inktober started yesterday and I’m so pumped up for it 
Also I baked chocolate muffins "

Thank you to all those who participate in these fun polls.  
Feel free to elaborate on tips below.I look at any notes I’ve taken, re-read my code from bottom to top…looking for possible errors that I may have missed. I also always google the error (b/c I know that I’m not the only one who’s ever gotten the error) and check the documentation to see what I may have done wrong. And if I’m really stuck, I walk away for a time and do something else unrelated to code. Oftentimes, that helps to figure it out too.Error messages are like my best friends when I’m stuck.
I like going over the steps my program should be following in my head, then analize my code line by line (without assuming anything works correctly) and see if it matches the list of steps I just went through.
I usually like to spend a lot of time trying to fix errors, but knowing when to walk away (not forever, obviously) is important too I ask a very good friend of mine. His name starts with G and has two Os "
308,Running Jupyter Notebook through VSCode,Tips and Resources,0,261,"I’m sure everybody and their mother knows this, but I just found out you can run Jupyter Notebook in VSCode! Do you know what this means to me? Oh, let me count the ways:

No more navigating to the folder through terminal, calling jupyter notebook, and working in my browser. I can just open VSCode.
I can see the files I’m working with in the explorer without switching tabs.
Dark themes without the drawbacks of Jupyter Themes. (Has anyone else installed Jupyter Themes just to find out the code box cuts off the last two characters? I have.)
Split screen in the same window that adjusts your code as you change the split, rather than covering your work with another window.
A built-in export as feature. I can export my work as python script, HTML, or even a pdf-- without Latex!
I can use my own environments instead of just Python 2 or Python 3.

I’m sure there are other things, too. VSCode has SO MANY extensions. What a game changer.

309,About Losing Connection to Codecademy,Tips and Resources,1,106,"Hi there. I am having some troubles by losing my connection to Codecademy Editor where I am studying an doing my assignments and all that stuff. it happens to me every 60-90ish seconds! it’s crazy, it’s impossible to work that way. It goes and comes but sometimes it does not come so I have to refresh the page and usually all I did was not saved (just because it happens in the middle of the coding work). Any suggestion how to solve it? Did you experience kind of that?. PS: I am not having any problem with other stuff such as Zoom, Surfing web pages, gmail, or other remote connections. I appreciate any help/comment/experience you can share.  Hi @christianfdev01,
Try these lost connection 4  ideas and see if you have any success."
310,Anyone else frustrated with how out of date a lot of the projects are?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,6,190,"I am almost finished with the Create a Back-End App with JavaScript course and many of the projects in this course are very out of date. Because the projects are not updated regularly, it has become a huge time killer to simply get a project to a point where you can even start it.
The project I am currently on (X-Press Publishing) was build on node v9 and sqlite v3.1.9! Node is currently at v14 and sqlite is at v3.33. I think it is ridiculous that these projects are using dependencies that are 3+ years out of date. It also is not just this project. A project right before it in this course (Gold Medal Metrics) also has issues working on a computer with current package versions.
Seriously, it is unacceptable for a company based around programming to have such bad practices. Learn Python The Hard Way 3 was released in 2013 and it can still be used currently to learn how to program with python3. It is crazy to me that this book has been updated 3 time since it has come out and it continues to remain a relevant source for learning programming, yet this website is still using old and outdated packages.
Sorry for the ranting, I’m just incredibly frustrated from spending two hours trying to get npm install to run successfully. If you have experience with this in other courses, I’d love to hear about it. What other broken projects have you encountered and did you manage to get it working?I totally get where you are coming from. I’ve just completed this series of lessons and I lost time getting the projects to a point where I could actually start working on them. I lost momentum as I had to go off on a tangent to the work I was planning to do.
To take something positive from it, I now know how to recognise and solve this problem which is a useful skill for the future. No doubt if called to work on an existing project this may be something we encounter.
I agree that it isn’t on that we should encounter these issues in a paid training product. It is a valuable lesson, but one we should encounter intentionally and with guidance as opposed to accidentally due to lack of maintenance.
I contacted the help desk about the React API lessons teaching deprecated material and they replied saying they are updating these lessons. We can only hope they are addressing the other issues too.I hear you.
Also, as @winningblue mentioned you may encounter old codebases in a current or future job that you have, so, it’s good practice to know the older code. I mean, case in point: NJUI’s system was based on COBOL. They had to put out a call to older programmers to help them update their system.
I also started learning Python on LPTHW. Same thing here. I couldn’t learn Node.js because CC’s version was so out of date, I was like “Man, this ain’t gonna be actually useful for me to learn”. Guess I’ll just have to find somewhere else to learn it 
What I didn’t know is that their SQL version was out of date. And I completed every single SQL course in here. Anyone here knows if there really is a significant difference between v3.1.9 and v3.3.3 that I should be worried about?Hey everyone, Codecademy staff here. I’m sorry that the packages for these projects are causing such problems.
Our curriculum QA team hasn’t grown nearly as quickly as our catalog, so now they are trying to address issues in a wide variety of languages, courses, and paths. We’re aware of this and we’re trying to get caught back up.
Schedule some time to meet with me if you want to discuss things further, I’m really happy to chat with anyone on this thread about how we can be maintaining our content more effectively: https://calendly.com/sbakkila/codecademy-creator 4@yizuhi The current sqlite version is actually 3.33.0.

I’m actually browsing thru  the articles “Pass the Technical Interview with Java” in order to consolidate my basic understanding of Java and eventually pass the OCA exam in a while.
So far, I’m really enjoying the experience and like the way the articles are diplayed but I’m wonderring how recent this has been writen because it seems to me that some concepts are slightly outdated and could do a good use of a small refresh.
As an exemple:
1. Getting Started With Data Structures >
Java Reviews >
Additional Important Java Topics.
It seems to me that Dictionary objects are obselete.
Is there any updates comming to this Tutos?
I found this class a bit by mistake and I was sooo happy, but maybe, yeah small refresh needed?

 ariella22:

Wrap the text of each list item in the unordered list in an anchor element.


Do you understand this? <li></li> is the list item, each list item has text, which should be wrapped in an anchor element (<a></a>)
anchor elements allow us to make hyperlink reference to different pages, or in this case, different div elements on the same page using the ids. So the list item that says introduction, should have a hyperlink reference (href attribute) pointing to #introduction. Which reference to <div id=""introduction"">, so that when text in anchor element is clicked, the page jumps to the div with id introductionThe mistake I did not realize I was making is that the id inside the first half of the anchor has to all lower case but the id at the end of the anchor has to be capitalized. So, a href=""#introduction"">Introduction

315,What Music and Computers have in Common,Corner Bar,21,248,"I’ve always liked to kick back by listening to listening to the latest pop hits (Comment down below who your favourite singer is!), or listening to classical music whenever I’m studying, which is why I was inspired by this post. With back to school starting (for most of us on this forum, I bet), there’s no doubt that to get through our everyday struggles or to just keep living, music will be our aid for whenever we’re stressed. But how do they tie into computer science? The science behind music and their impact on our lives is a phenomenon constantly being reevaluated by researchers, from the role of synthesis to movement of someone’s body being translated into sound energy, it’s insane. I really like how computer science has been evolving like this, but I just think it somewhat takes away from appreciating old classics. Because can I be real, no one listens to Beethoven anymore, like the guy’s last album came out like a millennium ago! Making music has always been a way to socialize and bring a community together, and it’s really strengthening now even more, which is great! Like no complaints, I’m glad the queens be dominating the industry, and helping expand their network, because that usually means more music for us. But this in some ways, can also cause problems, believe it or not. Feedback from audiences, live shows, and other events that help mold singers to become human in the public’s eyes can be edited by software, which creates a false impression for a lot of viewers that they’re idols are such authority figures. Don’t get me wrong, looking up to a public figure is great, but if they abuse this, then that just negatively impacts the follower. It deceives some people in a way, so can it be argued that it has a negative or positive impact? That’s just my take on this new technology, tell me what you think! I just wanted to share this with everyone to let them be informed, and I guess it it sort of my story on what I think about music and technology. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to listen to some pop.I like to think of it like knowing assembly language or C. Relatively few programmers know it well (in proportional to the total amount of programmers), but in history it has been the backbone of our current programming languages and they shape how they were developed.
While the demand for Beethoven pales in comparison to modern pop, the sonority of a full orchestra still permeates all our movie, shows, video game, and commercial soundtracks… and it’s not something that is likely to go away. Of course, where do  many of those modern composers begin to learn their craft? The classics.Okay, first things first.


Some of my favorite artists

BTS
Falcon (Amanda Lindsey Cook)
Dante Bowe
Hillsong Young and Free
Jenna Raine
The Into The Spider-verse Soundtrack (yeah ik that’s an album and not an artist but )

Is it too obvious that I’m a christian teen? 




 toastedpitabread:

Simply gotta agree with that. I love listening to “Epic Covers” of songs I like (Frostudio Chambersonic is probably my favorite Epic Covers channel).
Now back to computer science…I recently found this 3 article here on CC, and I just found it really cool. Like, wow, you can do that? It also kind of scared me, cause…we could soon have machines write songs for us? Like, WHAAAAAT?!  
Lately I’ve been so amazed at how we can actually use technologies for seriously ANYTHING that interests us.


 yizuhi:

The Into The Spider-verse Soundtrack (yeah ik that’s an album and not an artist but )


me who listens to this at least once per day YASSS! What’s your favorite track? By track I hope you mean song, so Familia (but I love ALL of them). Also your Christian, programmer, artist, and a Marvel fan girl. Sis. OMG you are too?! Dang, I finally found someone like me here  
I LOVE Familia too (man I do love all of them ). But if I had to choose I think I’d go with Sunflower, it just never fails to put a smile on my face

Btw I read the article and I’m not surprised what machines are capable of doing. Now can you design one to do my homework for me? Please?Ahaha, yeah, that would be amazing 
I honestly don’t know why I had such a limited…ummm…what’s the word…vision? Of what machines are able to do. I need to inform myself better lolDid you know they have designed machines to cook and organize(?) food on plates in some resturants? I can’t wait to be able to help with things like that but I’m still in school which is taking up most of my time lately .Woah 
Same here, I’ve been working on a school project that leaves up almost no time for other things I love doing 
I mean I try to always make time to learn about the things that truly interest me (and to draw), and I am usually able to, but lately school has just been nuts.
Thank God I’ve been homeschooled my whole life lol, otherwise I’d be struggling a lot in these times.That’s so cool, like what? Also I need a homework machine like stat guyss. Tell me about it. Realized I never told u my favourite artists. They are: Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Cardi B, and… that’s basically it. So, there’s that. Also, you’ve been home schooled for your whole life? Woah, I wonder what’s that like, I’ve always loved like going to school which is why even during the pandemic, I’ve decided to go. Actually, my first day is tomorrow!Haha, yeah we all do 



 giga2095771915:

Tbh I don’t listen to any of those, so 



 giga2095771915:

Also, you’ve been home schooled for your whole life? Woah, I wonder what’s that like


It’s actually pretty cool. My Dad is in charge, and let me tell ya, his brain never rests. He’s always coming up with new projects and new things he wants me to learn. He’s the one who got me into programming. So yeah, my homeschool is a lot of fun (even if it’s stressful sometimes…like right now) 



 giga2095771915:

I’ve always loved like going to school which is why even during the pandemic, I’ve decided to go.


Well, good luck, and stay safe! thanks, they’re not my only favourite artists,btw, so see if you like listening to anymore, some other i listen to are: Micheal Jackson, Mariah Carey, ABBA, Blackpink- (they’re new collab with Selena is sic, by the way) if that’s more your style?Dang, sorry pal, I don’t listen to any of those either (I guess I have a very specific music taste lol) 
But I actually used to listen to Blackpink, and I still kind of do. (I like “How you like that?”)
Do you like k-pop in general or just Blackpink?Hey, i like k-pop I guess, but it was Blackpink who actually introduced me to the whole culture, so I listen to them a lot more. Occasionally, do listen to BTS, so does that work?Oh I see. I only listen to BTS and (ocassionaly) Blackpink so yeah, I think that works Itzhak Perlman – Beethoven: Violin Concerto (with Daniel Barenboim, Berliner Philharmoniker)
Pass that up and be the bigger fool. If you have time to learn then you have time to listen.I usually listen to orchestra, Christian country, or fiddling.
Favorite artists would be Thomas Bergurson, Paul Overstreet, and Lindsey Sterling.
I also really enjoy the Lord of the Rings soundtrack. "

I’ve been with Codecademy for over three years now, starting off as a Curriculum Developer writing content. I’ve touched a lot of different content over the years, like Learn HTML, Data Visualization with Python, Learn C#, and Learn How to Code (I like to call the one my brain baby). I currently live in Brooklyn, NY and spend my free time hanging out with friends at Prospect Park, reading longform articles, doing puzzles, and cuddling my cat, Nono. In my prior life, I was an art teacher and I’m currently part of two art collectives: tendernet and The Illuminator.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
I was finishing up my Masters Degree at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program when I got an email from a Codecademy recruiter asking if I wanted to apply for the Curriculum Developer position. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect - I was right about to publicly present my thesis (like, two hours away) and in the midst of figuring out my next steps. The interview process moved really quickly and in a couple weeks I joined the team!
Did you always want to be a Curriculum Product Manager?
Given that I made up the role myself, not really, haha. I’ve had a lot of different career goals in my life (including, at one point, being the female version of Indiana Jones). What I will say is that as soon as I started working at Codecademy, I became interested in the product side of things. Having gone to a graduate program that focused on invention, early on I wanted to start pushing the boundaries of what our Curriculum content and experience could be.
I started by experimenting in a couple of courses that I built, then moved on to making a highly experimental course (Learn How to Code), which we treated like a product, rather than just content. We did a lot of research to develop it and a series of user interviews to iterate on what we made. I learned a lot from that experience and kept looking for opportunities to bring a pedagogical and creative perspective to how we teach. It took a couple years, but I feel like I’ve crafted my (at least for now) dream role.
What are the best aspects about working as a Curriculum Product Manager?
Making up new things! I love combining what I hear from learners with my research into educational theory to come up with curriculum products, all the while keeping an eye towards the future of EdTech. I have a very interdisciplinary background and I get to pull on my creative thinking, research, design, education, and programming experiences as part of my work. It’s been really exciting to see ideas that I was working through in my notebooks appear as new courses or content items on the site. Another thing I love is that my role is a cross-team role, which means I get to collaborate with folks across the company, including other Curriculum team members, Product, Design, and Engineering. It’s a constant learning experience.
What are the worst aspects about working as a Curriculum Product Manager?
Not having enough time and resources  There are so many things we want to build, but it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort to turn those ideas into reality. It’s also risky! We can do lots of experiments and user interviews and feel relatively confident that we’re making the right things, but we really won’t know how it will perform until we put it in front of learners. I also like iterating on things, which we don’t often have the chance to do because we need to move to new projects and focus less on maintenance and improvements. But we’re moving to a more iterative approach, we’re hiring more folks, so hopefully it will be smoother sailing in the future.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
Teleportation is always rad, but I think I’m specifically attached to the TARDIS. I like that it can take you anywhere in the universe, but also anywhere in time. Plus, it’s a home! And you get to be Doctor Who’s companion! Sign me up for intergalactic #vanlife.
Do you have any advice for the learners?
Don’t be a perfectionist. It took me so long to get into coding because I kept getting frustrated with errors and went to classmates who knew more than me to help me out, rather than stick with the issue and try to make something - anything! - that worked that I made entirely on my own. I really had to re-learn how to learn when it came to programming and break down my assumptions of what being “good” at something meant, or even if being “good” was important! Getting rid of those types of hangups allowed me to be more exploratory as I built things and a lot kinder to myself as I learned something new.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Just one? So tough! I come from a creative technology background and really want to expand our offerings in that area. I’ve got a p5.js course kicking in the background that we’re finally making (three years after I proposed it!). I’ve also always wanted to make a Unity course, since that interface is notoriously difficult to learn (plus it pairs well with the Learn C# course I wrote in 2019). Three.js is another fun technology that has very few learning resources. I also have a dream of an online, interactive way of learning Arduino and electronics. I have lots of friends who teach creative technology and I think these courses would be useful to them as they approach teaching online for the first time.
What does a typical day look like for you?
Now that I work from home everyday, a typical day for me is getting woken up by my cat at 9am and rolling into the living room to do some morning yoga (she loves yoga because I’m stuck on the mat and have to give her pets).
Most of my days are packed with meetings - I lead our senior curriculum developers in a weekly meeting where we discuss our current content production, then I’ll meet with the developers working on our new career paths. Some days it’s going to a cross-team standup and checking in with the engineers and designers building out our new curriculum products. On some days I get a few hours to myself, which I use to knock out writing specs, reviewing content and designs.
After the work day is over (which can sometimes be rather late…) my boyfriend and I usually make dinner. We like to try new things, but we’ve also perfected what we call “Quarantine Chicken” - bone-in, skin-on thighs with lots of herbs de provence, cooked in a cast iron skillet and finished in the oven. Most of my life I’ve been stuffing my non-work hours with side projects and collaborations, but recently I’ve slowed down my non-work projects and trying to commit to genuinely relaxing. I bought a switch at the beginning of quarantine and Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild are my favorite ways to unwind. That and the crossword and spelling bee puzzles on the NYT crossword app.

319,Mid-life career change,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",7,3.5k,"Never realized that this forum was here on codecademy…  
I’m a 40yo with 20 years in print and digital graphic design.  Over the last 8 years, I have self-taught myself HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL/SQL Server, and enough javascript, jQuery and Ajax to be dangerous.  I have several front-facing sites for possible clients/employers to review, but most of my work are internal sites and HTML-based reports.
Currently, my FTJ is based more around BI/data-analysis, operations, marketing and graphic design.  I really want to make the move to developing on a full-time basis.
What steps should I take to make the jump?
TIA, LincolnWant to share some of that work with us so we can see a bit more about where you’re at?
Have you already been applying for work?  Do you want to be a full-stack developer?  You should give us more information!Hello Daniel,
Links, to a few public-facing sites that I have developed, are at the end of this comment.
I’m not sure about full-stack, or if I even have enough knowledge to pursue that route.  I enjoy solving problems.  If I’m unsure of how to accomplish something, I will research and learn until I can figure a way to achieve the end result. I have no problem designing/developing from beginning to end.
I have not applied anywhere.  Not even sure if I’m qualified to do so… kind of the reason I’m posting. 
I desire to telecommute, and must be able earn > $75k annually to transition to this, but don’t know if my knowledge level is commensurate.
Example Work:
http://calc.nwapawn.com 311 – internal precious metal calculator for a  pawnshop. circa 2011?
http://www.nwapawn.com 204 – pawnshop website. 2015?
http://dev.soleradentalspa.com 137 – in development. pending client content
http://www.vizualmagazine.com 255 – NSFW Glamour photography magazine website 2015/16?
There is more, but I am unable to share publicly.If you worked on all of these mainly independently and from start to finish, I would say you are definitely qualified for a full stack career at the very least a junior position.
These sites are impressive! Love the design and the concept of the calculator. I like that the NSFW link is getting the most clicks!
A problem that I’d foresee here (and take this with a grain of salt, my guidance counselor days were several years ago) is that if you have only four projects to show me here.  To demonstrate true passion about coding, it’s best to have a whole ream of projects, even if they aren’t for clients.  Employers won’t care if your stopwatch app is no different than the  10,000 other stopwatch apps out there, what matters is that you made it and it demonstrates your skill & passion.  If you’ve already been working with clients for development work and you have some examples to show, that’s a great start - do more of that, get more and more projects that you’ve done professionally for clients.  That, to a large extent, makes you a professional developer in and of itself, and you should think & market yourself as such.  For the places where you can’t share work, make sure you have good references to share.

[Career Talk] Graphic Design to Web Design Careers, Journeys, and Stories


    Hey Codecademy, I’m a graphic/visual designer and I’ve been learning some HTML and CSS on your site.  I’ve had fun so far!  I’m considering whether going into a web design or front-end development track is right for me, and if I need “full stack” skills.

[AMA] what skills should a fullstack developer have Careers, Journeys, and Stories


    Hi I'm Brian, I lead hiring at Codecademy so I can answer this from my perspective in what I look for in new hires! 

When you ask what kind of skills, do you mean on the technical side or on the ""soft skills"" side?  I'll answer the second one, partially because I think that's something that should be discussed a lot more, but if you were thinking more about the first let me know. 

Problem solving ability, communication ability are both paramount.  I look for a hunger to learn, and a willingnes…
  


It won’t stop you from getting a job if you aren’t building projects for yourself on the side or if you don’t have more work to show to a prospective employer, but it will slow you down.  As Oscar says (and I agree), if those projects you link to are all your own work… they’re great quality.  They don’t necessarily demonstrate much back-end experience, so if you want to pursue that, you should keep building.

Throw everything up on your GitHub as you go, that’s very important.  Consider making your own personal portfolio page like this 98, this 38, or this 31 where you can populate it with your coding projects and information (particularly professional information) about yourself.

320,Old School Programmer here! recycling Knowledge and restarting,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,199,"Hi there, I am returning to programming after…15 years.
That was my first career, my “first love” but my journey forked to business and management instead of Analyst Programmer. I made my degree in business and administration, my MBA and now, I moved to States for work almost two years ago,  I am in a new path to recycle myself as Analyst Programmer. my first language was Pascal, after VB, C, OOP, C++, Cobol!!!, relational DB, boole algebra, etc, etc… I see that something has changed a little…but I am feeling great! because I am still thinking as a programmer…kind of rusty but great. I would like to hear from people like me, Generation X, how they face it, if you can give some advice, etc… I am now in the path of Web Developer but as I usually did, I am a self-learner in parallel rading books, tutorials etc. Okey, I appreciate ANY piece of advice you can give!!
Thanks!!!To be honest, if you’re competent with COBOL then… you might make some decent money sticking with it. It might not be the latest and greatest in terms of languages, but there’s a lot of stuff still using it (including in government and the public sector) and not a lot of people who can wrangle it…Welcome to the forums.
Gen X here too. 
The state of NJ needed to hire you when their unemployment system needed to be upgraded back in March (it’s based on COBOL) when they got inundated with UI claims! They’ve since fixed it I think.
Anyway, I don’t think age is a factor in learning. IMO one should always be learning something or else they’ll be stagnant. I think it’s great to supplement what you’re learning on CC with reading books, official language documentation and other tutorials. As long as you set aside some time every day to learn and make sure that you solidify the concepts in your brain before moving on to the next lesson, that’s a great start.Hi, Generation X here as well. 75’s class. I’m exactly in the same path right now. Started as web programmer 15 years ago and after 5 years I moved to Infrastructure and have been working on that. This year I decided to move back to my first love, creating web applications. I am now in the path of full stack Developer on Codecademy and starting a bootcamp in October. I feel excited to start this new experience. Coding for me is like something natural, when I start I can go on all day long, because I like what I do and this, at my age, is something absolutely valuble. Enjoying your job and having fun doing the work.
Congratulations for your decision. It’s a brave choice.
Cheers"

322,Ask a Stupid Question Day,Random,7,121,"We all have things we would like to know, and a good portion of us have things we feel like we already should know.  
Yet for some odd reason, we seem to steer away from asking these questions. In reality though that just leaves us devoid of the knowledge we are wanting.
Some have felt so strongly about this fact to even go as far as making a holiday, and since the 1980s, on September 28 Ask a Stupid Question Day has been one to celebrate by asking these kind of questions.
We are all learners here, we all have our own interests, and more than likely we all have our own questions we would like to ask, so if you are curious about something, go ahead and ask a question today. 

In fact here is mine (or at least one of them) for the day  :
I’ve been studying front end web development since April, yet I am curious about something. Is JavaScript the only language that web browsers can use for front end interactivity?Why do people hate on python?Well I suppose it depends on the specific person though there are a number of possibilities.
Though Python is easy to use very flexible and a powerful high level language, it does have its drawbacks.
Here are a few I can point out.


It is not a precompiled language and as such can run a good deal slower if you are running a large program.


This is the one that gets me. Its indentation system makes whitespace much harder to use, as compared to a language such as C++ that designates code blocks with brackets:


def add(n1, n2):
    new_number = n1 + n2
    return new_number
#    \ 
#    Whitespace indentation must march up throughout the code block

int add(int n1, int n2) {

int new_number = n1 + n2;
    return new_number

//Because brackets designate code blocks you can have mixed indentation. This allows much more flexibility.
}


A lot of people, especially new users have trouble getting module to install properly, and I have seen a lot of irritation arise from the use of pip.


I’m sure there are a lot more reasons, but these are just a few off the top of my head, that I see as drawbacks.Actually a good question 
I don’t think there are a lot of people who hate Python. But all programming languages there are pros and cons.
I used to like python a lot, years ago when I started programming. And I still like it, but less.
For me personally two major reasons are: Lack of static typing. Sure, python3.8 introduced some type hinting, but could be better. When your project starts to grow, its nice to know what type your arguments need to be and what type you get in return.
and secondly, lack of proper encapsulation in classes. Python as a language doesn’t enforce encapsulation. When working a lot of classes and inheritance, this can become very problematic
Don’t get me wrong, if I would need to build a simple web scraper (and other things), I would still use python, in fact, python might then be my first choice.



 8-bit-gaming:


It is not a precompiled language and as such can run a good deal slower if you are running a large program.



to add to @8-bit-gaming point here, speed is not the only factor. Compiling might also help to catch errors earlier (during compile) as oppose to on run time (when you actual run the program)


 8-bit-gaming:

I’ve been studying front end web development since April, yet I am curious about something. Is JavaScript the only language that web browsers can use for front end interactivity?


There is a web assembly, but I have done very little reading on the matter of late.
Doesn’t seem to gain a lot of popularity yet. JavaScript seems to have strong footing. But web assembly is certainly interesting to do some reading on

Or when you get an error that tells you off for using tabs and spaces-when, to you anyway, the indenting looks the same. Argh!

A language like Java has 4 levels of access protection for class properties and methods:
image1280×434 143 KB
only public properties and methods can be accessed on a class instance.
protected methods and properties can be accessed by child classes. And so forth
from stackoverflow:
Python does not support access protection as C++/Java/C# does. Everything is public. The motto is, “We’re all adults here.” Document your classes, and insist that your collaborators read and follow the documentation.
I think a language should enforce the access. Otherwise developers could abuse the intended access."
323,[Video] What employers look for in a portfolio,Featured Challenges and Events,0,611,"Resumes are a ubiquitous part of every professional field, and you’ve probably made one before. They’re good at describing your skills and experiences along two dimensions—what you’ve done and how long you’ve done it for. On the other hand, a portfolio website can represent you and your capabilities as a vivid, three-dimensional portrait.
You can describe the inspiration for a project, the process of building something collaboratively, unexpected challenges, or anything else that seems relevant. Just remember: recruiters are busy people, so just because you can include some information doesn’t mean you should.
Before you start thinking about the sorts of projects you might want to build and include in your portfolio, heed this advice: when in doubt, just start coding.
Your portfolio is, first and foremost, a testament to your ability to build things, and at this stage, any project you complete will be a valuable learning experience. Any project that seems fun and interesting to you is one you’re more likely to complete, and that’s all the reason you need to get started.

almost finished with SQL. Started for fun making a game with Phaser JsDay 2 checked. Things are getting interesting.Hi! I’m Zach, the cofounder and CEO of Codecademy. I’ve been looking to get a little deeper into our numbers lately, so I’m digging into our Analyze Data with SQL path! Looking forward to learning with all of you and to keeping each other accountable.Day 3 SQL getting hard need a lot more time to complete the tasks.Day 3 checked. Playing with lists in Python is interesting, and sometimes confusing. I feel like this part is very essential.Hey I’m Steven, and in the next 14 days, I plan to learn some more C# and finish up my Game Development with PhaserJS course.Day 4 check! Im a bit stuck with SQL but have a lot off fun with Phaser.JsDay 4 checked. Only did a little bit today. Hopefully I could do more tomorrow.Day 5 done. Finished the lists and functions part of Learn Python 2.Day 5 check! Today didn’t have so much time for coding but still managed it.Hi! I’m Alyssa, a community manager with Codecademy. Big  to all of you that stuck to your goals this week!
What was most helpful in motivating you to stick to the challenge week 1?

Hey, thanks so much for sharing! These were actually just re-released this week! Nice find Thank you for this overview! Does anyone know how these shortcuts work for a German keyboard layout? For me the “Load the next exercise”-shortcut does not work. This is a bit annoying. Did you find a solution?"
329,Why I haven’t bought Codecademy Pro,Community,15,13.2k,"I got an email the other day about new Python courses. Python is my favorite (and first) programming language, so I decided to take a look.
The Python 3 course is a Pro-only course. Making this a Pro-only course is not a good idea. Python 2 was originally released in 2000, while Python 3 (a major upgrade) was released in 2008. Because of the consistent updates (we’re at 3.7 now) of Python, it’s not feeling its age in any way. However, Python 2 is now a 10-year old language with updates that are simply bugfixes.
Is it okay to learn a language set in stone? Maybe. People still program in C89, and that’s coming to its 30-year anniversary. But I don’t understand why the features of Python 3 are locked behind a paywall. You can buy a Python 3 book for a month’s worth of Pro and your money would be spent more effectively.
The Minimax course didn’t explicitly say it was a Pro course in the email (which I won’t criticize), but shows another fault of Pro: there’s no taste of the more advanced stuff unless you get your free seven-day trial.
Another problem I have with the Pro courses is that they aren’t cost-effective. Look up “learning pandas python” and you will find many FREE tutorials for learning the pandas library with Python. You save 100% of the money you would have spent buying Pro for a month, no matter which plan you buy.
So what’s the point of this? I don’t care for the “be a Pro if you want to learn more” mentality. I don’t know anything about marketing; maybe it’s just fine. But as someone who needs a lot of convincing to get anything you need to pay for, this is a bit frustrating.
Does the price seem reasonable to you for what you get? What are some Pro subscribers’ and non-subscribers’ thoughts?


 triskaidekaphile:

But as someone who needs a lot of convincing to get anything you need to pay for, this is a bit frustrating.


Solve this problem before moaning about investing $20 a month into an education facility.As someone who recently signed up for Pro membership, I feel there is a lot of value for what really amounts to just the cost of a couple cups worth of coffee per month (trust me, not trying to give you a sales pitch here).
What sold me was the access to the learning Paths and the additional projects you get to solidify what you’ve learned. I’m taking the Web Developer path right now and I looked it over thoroughly before subscribing to Pro. I was impressed by how the path was a fully structured curriculum aimed at giving you a specific skillset and the breadth of content and length was similar to what you would get from a community college or trade school certificate program (for significantly cheaper). For example, in my area, a 12 week web developer certificate course at a technical school would require me to attend 3-hr night classes twice a week and would cost me ~$2000 or more - and I don’t even know if they would get into full stack web development in that time (versus just focusing on HTML/CSS).
Additionally, versus a book or YouTube videos, you can’t beat the guided learning structure that Codecademy does really well. My favorite part is how it automatically scans and checks your work as your progress. Yes, you can buy a book and follow that or go through free tutorials on YouTube but I have always found they lacked structure and for me there was always the uncertainty of “is this going to teach me all I need to know?”. I’ve bought books on C+ in the past and have struggled with following along. I’m not saying you can’t find the right resources for free online, but $20/month removes all the guesswork, all the searching and gives you a structured curriculum from trusted instructors.
Again, I’m not trying to give you a hard sell on it and this is just my genuine opinion as a Pro subscriber. Perhaps try some of the free courses first and see if you like it enough. If you look through the Paths, you can also get a sneak peak of what you would have access to with a Pro membership - you can even see all the sections, courses and projects you would get.
I hope this helps. All the best to you!My goal is to be a full blown software engineer, or a web dveloper at the least. Seeing as I don’t have hours to spend searching for tutorials, or even the time to google “Python tutorial” Codecademy is by far worth paying for due to my time constraints. I did buy a couple of reference book seeing as I sometimes get confused at the syntax.
Also CC offers many courses on many different languages, they also have courses to help you publish websites/history of coding etc. and you get all of that for $20 a month not just one course.
Different things work for different people, my biggest reason is that I dont have hours of time to spend doing this and if I had to spend time searching for lessons or even had to spend time reviewing or cheking my own work I wouldn’t be able to get my other work done.Wow. Ok, that was intersting. I think that since it costs money to keep up a webpage, they need to do it somehow though I’m not entirely happy about that either.
I hope this helps =)Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I guess Pro isn’t for everyone, so I didn’t want to ruin their experience, but I felt there were some “flaws” I felt compelled to address. Quotation marks because not everyone feels that way.Personally, I’m kind of torn between pro/ not pro. I started “pro” less than a week ago mainly for the extra projects you can do. I like the structure it provides through the paths section as well as the content it gives you. I noticed that it follows closely in-line with the courses I was taking through Udacity, but these subjects seem to be filling in the huge blanks I was getting through Udacity. I also like the fact that the courses I’ve been seeing in the website developer path is mostly stuff I would do on a daily basis and not useless information I’m never going to use again.I think most of the folks always miss the point that a Pro subscription gives you access to real time advisor help available 16 hours a day. It is located at each and every lesson’s bottom right’s chat widget.
You can really chitchat with them if you want. Sometimes I see people here posting questions about a Pro project, which certainly reduce the workload of our advisors 
Code review and 1-on-1 guidance aren’t normally available through books or youtube.Yeah the entirety of pro is completely worth it. Like lots of people have said, the paths are sooooooooo much better than just learning each language you need individually.  Instead of shoving an insane amount of information in your mind at once, paths do a really good job at doing it little by little.
Pro 10/10.  Learning on your own from a book or a video is just not the same as the Paths. Worth it.I have a certification form Duke University via coursera. The only way that I was able to get the syntax was by using CC.So you think that Pro is worth the money?The only downside to it IMHO is that there is no certification, Degree, or something you can put on your resume. BUT I have known people whose interviewers have had them show them their CC profile. But I assume that’s rare. CC now teaches Whiteboarding Which is awesome for interviews. That’s another thing that really isn’t taught in most 2-year degree programs or even four-year programs.
I have a friend who got a masters in CS from Harvard and then had to pay 5k to go and take an interview course which discussed whiteboarding a lot. it’s really a valuable skill to have.
I have a very close friend who used CC to learn several years ago and now makes over $35 per hour, with the number of courses available now you may even be able to do even better.
it’s also really important to have many skills, not just one. For example, Most 2 year programs make you decide what kind of Dev you want to be which is good because you get a deeper knowledge of certain languages but you can’t be an all around developer. Heres an example:
These are the languages you learn at a 2-year program where I live (we have on of the top Comunity Colleges)

HTML, XHTML, HTML5 * CSS/CSS3 * Web design principles * Mobile site design * Database Fundamentals * Javascript * AngularJS * ASP.NET * PHP * MySQL * Adobe Dreamweaver * Internet Marketing * SEO * Web analytics * WordPress * Joomla * UI/UX

While this is awesome and gives you great knowledge in Web development you still haven’t learned things like Python, Jquery, Bootstrap, Java, Ruby, React, Command line, Git. All things that you CAN LEARN with CC. And those other things like “Internet marketing” and “SEO” you can simply learn with the awesome courses from coursera for a lot cheaper and a lot less time.
BTW, anyone please feel free to message me or to ask for specific courses I recommend. (Most of my information I get is from industry professionals that I am very close friends or family with)Thanks =)
So the courses here are worth it if you’re willing to pay.Well there are different things people “want” from a curriculum.   The offerings u get free are great.  Does pro content offer more… I feel it does…so I am comfortable paying.  I didn’t commit right away until I felt like I would see a return on investment.   End of day there are lots of freebies out there.  The Odin Project being my personal favorite, as its structured but less hand holding.
No one forcing a subscription, but it also lots of content and time here that I can understand the desire to monetize.   So as long as it’s not forced and the free content is relevant it fair to me.If you can’t get a real university degree from Codecademy pro, then I don’t think they should charge moneyI’m not sure what the charge is, so let’s just say twenty bucks. Times twelve, times four to seven years,
>>> a, b = 20 * 12 * 4, 20 * 12 * 7
>>> a, b
(960, 1680)

Given that there is usually a discount for long term, possibly as high as 50 per-cent, that means you could get seven years of Pro access for under a grand.
That wouldn’t pay for textbooks in the first year, let alone the six or more thousand in tuition each year.
How much education and certification should one expect for $120 a year? That is far less than we pay for Netflix, considered a mere out-of-pocket expense for TV on demand with no commercials.
What you suggest is pushing the boundaries on ludicrous, and screams of entitlement. If one could get a degree for 20 bucks a month (or 60 dollars a year) we’d all be sporting them on the walls of our office or den, in droves. Unfortunately that is far from reality.
CC is one way to become immersed in a set of skills that enable us to move forward more confidently, and perhaps earn admission to a college or university in a discipline we’ve proven an aptitude for, or at the very least an internship where we can pick up production environment experience and gain employment from that with a living wage and benefits.
Enabling is the key. CC enables, and we empower. We hold the power, CC provides a vehicle with which to propel ourselves forward, under our own power."
330,Are data structures & algorithms needed for front end developer!,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,105,"I want to apply for a React js or Front End web developer job but I was wondering in the interview will they ask me and test me about these topics that I mentioned in the title?That’s very specific of the hiring process of the company you want to work for. Your best bet is to reach out to current engineers there and ask them for the kind of hiring process they do. They most likely won’t be able to tell you specifics, but at least they might give you a hint on the kind of trick questions, algorithms or other topics!
Data structures tend to be very basic anyways, so it would be in your best interest to learn about them even if you don’t think you’ll need them."
331,Time To Code!,Random,17,211,"When is your favorite time to code- morning, noon, or night? (or are you the type to pull an all nighter everyday ) Also, does it vary from day to day, or do you stick to a schedule?As a rule I try to avoid late nights for anything important if I can help it… for trivial things I’ll allow myself to code at night if I have the energy.
I try to divide it more into times when I have clarity and energy. So usually not right after an hour of doing something else that’s mentally difficult/tiring. I try to set all the “difficult” conceptual stuff earlier so I know I can tackle it (and usually this involves planning to get a good sleep as well if it’s important).
Obviously it’s a very personal system. Mileage will vary greatly.@toastedpitabread I totally agree!I think that’s a very nice approach you have to tackle code.
Sleep is important, and so is that energy! It varies from moment to moment.
(Heh, it’s a quote from…nevermind)
But yeah it really varies, although I usually like to code from 3pm to 6pm I like to code all the time. Any time I could get to code, I would do it. You also have to work hard and grind. See, I am just a beginner. I still need to learn the rest of HTML. I prefer early morning when I have had some coffee.
Sometimes in the afternoon and rarely at night unless I have the mental energy.
I agree with @toastedpitabread:



 toastedpitabread:

I try to divide it more into times when I have clarity and energy


  @yizuhi What are you up to these days?  (*ahem*…bruce)
also, “usually” is noted 
@aramservices Awesome advice! And hope you have a fun learning journey with your HTML  
@lisalisaj the early  gets the … coffee?   well said - early mornings and afternoons are great times, too!I code throughout the day, mostly afternoon, but then it is pretty much all just working on examples, not full fledged projects. Every two hours or so I take the dogs for a twenty minute walk which keeps up my posture and general fitness as well as giving my eyes a chance to look over many distances. It helps to reduce fatigue, both mental and vision.
Mind, we’re talking senior citizen here. Back in the day it was not uncommon to code from lunch time straight through the wee hours and sleep from 7 to noon. That was when I had multiple sites to maintain and upgrade over a sixteen year period. That’s all gone now so my time is my own. Best to look after one’s health, and have other priorities, not just coding.I usually code in the evenings, though it can vary day-to-day. I tend to lose focus late at night so I usually try to avoid coding then, unless I’ve got a deadline I have to meet  .omg yes 
I’m so glad you got the quote…or should I say You understood that reference? @mtf



 mtf:

Best to look after one’s health, and have other priorities, not just coding.


Oh yes, totally. It’s important that people are paying attention to their well-being -that is, social, mental, all aspects! Glad you try to unplug  every two hours or so 
@dr_victoria Logical!

@yizuhi oh “you’re not fooling us” here    …sometimes i wish there was a captain america emoji oh well Hehe 
Yeaah, I would love love a Cap emoji I found that building a habit helped me get to coding whenever I wanted. For example, at first I thought coding at 7am was tough. After doing it for a week now my mind goes automatically to “ok, breakfast done, let’s code!”
I’ve felt into the trap of “let’s just watch this one thing and I’ll get to it”, or “I’ll just do some gaming for a bit and get to it”. I was lying to myself. Those things took time and energy and then I felt less inclined to code, not more. Find what works for you! @irlfede I totally agree! When you set up a schedule, sure it may be tough to begin, but one does get used to it eventually. morning although it variesI prefer anytime when I can, as long as I know I am alert enough. With kids in the house, anytime when they are away or asleep is usually the best time for me!!@web9749744185 @irfankhan786 welcome!!
coding while alert is really best …like in the mornings! I try to code whenever I can.  If I’m on the go & I want to reinforce concepts, I’ll review on my phone using the Codecademy app.
Just this afternoon, I was able to make it to Codecademy’s Group Focus Session 1… it was my first time joining a study session like this & it went great!  I was able to meet other coders & spend almost an hour working on a project in the Data Science Career Path.  I hope to make it to more of these sessions!  (Thanks @lilybird for hosting!  )"
332,"55 years old and become a developer, a good idea?","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",16,1.0k,"I am 55 years old and I am a French woman.
I am learning as an autodidact on the internet since 2009.
Since that time, I had created two blogs with Wordpress, the only CMS I know that I really liked using.
For two years, I live in the south of France, I try to explain to people responsible for helping job seekers the importance of training in new technologies.
I sometimes had to explain what the job of developer to job counselors.
Twice I applied to integrate training with local organizations.
Twice I have been refused for false reasons.
So, I’m asking myself a question to which I would like you to answer frankly, without language.
In my region, there are many ‘profiles’ of the Mediterranean type, sexist, macho, arrears who think that women are in their place ‘elsewhere’.
My question is therefore :
Would you trust a person of my age who became a developer or would you consider it too old or HS to make your website or application ?
Is the world of new technologies open to those wishing to progress, to succeed, to perform well-honed work or is it only convinced by ‘young’ profiles?
Because why continue to train to change jobs if no one will trust me?
Thank you for your answers. :souriant:Hello @july_html  !
You probably won’t get hired at 55 by most companies, but no one says you can’t create your own apps or websites. It won’t be a whole job probably though, but it could a path.
I hope this helps =)While tech knows no age, indeed some of the tech of the fifties is in use today - mostly code maintenance but the point stands- companies always want/prefer young blood to keep (and supposedly to get fresh/new ideas from recent university graduates and the like), so that will probably be a barrier and the reason why people even in their 20s-30s (my case honestly) feel nervous about making a career
start/change.
You could probably make it as a freelancer or even get a desk job regardless with a good enough portfolio and some networking, so it’s more of a “is this what i want regardless of the challenges?” kind of deal. I’m rooting for you though!Thank you for your reply. 
How to know the ropes of this profession if one has not been salaried?
This is the experience. Some things are learned in a group because the problem arises during an exercise or while developing an application. This is so in every job. Before becoming a boss, it is better to have been employed by a company.
I doubt to be able to acquire sufficient mastery to be considered reliable by professionals.
Security management is an important thing that smart guys have already crossed on my ‘little’ personal site, not even hosted somewhere, just locally, at home.
All stolen and haggled in my place.
I have learned many things in my life and still today.
First I was secretary (20 years old). I hate this work uninteresting, repetitive, not creative or fulfilling.
Then to pay my bills, I worked in an industrial cleaning company then I became a housekeeper for another structure at home.
As an autodidact, during his last 15 years, I learned to draw, paint, write stories, scenarios, stories, articles about the politics of my country and the five continents.
And of course I learned to code, since I’m here. :clin d’œil:
I thank you for your candor.Thank you for your reply.
Some ‘young’ are older than the old ones 
I assure you that I met many in my life !
Especially in offices, well sheltered and who do not like change.
Sitting on their achievements and caring little about what they could bring to their departments, regions, countries and our planet.
I was not afraid to learn, it’s so interesting. Neither to change.
Dinosaurs are always among us and not the best we can count on.
As I said to Trevorhodges above, I doubt to be able to acquire enough knowledge to be considered reliable by companies.
Thank you for your franchise.I think you might find it a challenge to get a full-time role as a dev, but if you’ve got 10 years experience with WordPress you might be able to find something. 
If you’re already running a couple of sites that are powered by WordPress - which remains one of the more popular CMS on the web - then I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t set yourself up with a portfolio site to advertise what you’ve done, and try and get some freelance / contract work doing similar?
Alternatively, you could always take a look through some of the WordPress 1 projects on GitHub and see if there are any outstanding issues which you could contribute to fixing? There’s a GitHub label “good first issue” which projects use to highlight issues that might be a good starting point for new users/devs.
Open source work doesn’t (usually) pay, but it’s additional experience - both in terms of coding, and working as part of a larger team on a project - which can never be a bad thing. I had installed two showcase blogs:
1 to sell cars,
1 for my creative hobbies.
They were called: jdd.auto.services.free.fr 11 and domimland.free.fr 5.
I emptied both databases for a long time.
The vehicle sales business of this person no longer exists.
And for my WP I had to give up, to take care of mine before being able to accomplish what I like.
I have not reinstalled Wordpress since.
This is the only CMS I have used. It was very interesting, allowed me to do what I wanted, so malleable and intuitive.
In learning I had modified the basic themes chosen to adapt them to the needs.
Since then I have learned to use the code with lessons from here and elsewhere and am far from having completed the course.
That was why I wanted to enter a training center locally.
I will reflect on this eventuality.
Thanks for your advices.I’m a 42 years old male autodidact from the U.S., and those “sexist” profiles won’t even trust me.  What you’re experiencing isn’t based on gender, and therefore it’s not about machismo or misogyny or misandry (ahem).  It’s also not about race, age or (in my case) disability.
It’s about innate talent, focus, ability, and capability – all of which autodidacts excel at.  The experience is simply a natural consequence of how our minds work.  We don’t need school-based certification or training courses to develop the skills, although there are some parts of the industry that may require it for regulatory purposes.  We don’t need a team to get stuff done, we do our best work solo because we’re usually three steps ahead of the most-certified person in the group.  We’re blunt, honest, direct, brutally efficient and we show up to do our jobs… not to gossip about our co-workers, or stab them in the back.
When you start developing the experience that comes from applying that knowledge… people will trust you even less.  Both are still considered “too expensive”, compared to ignorance.  This isn’t just with computers and technology, it’s across the board.
Autodidacts do not conform, and conformity is what hiring managers want.  Autodidacts are independent leaders, and hiring managers want dependent followers who heed employment advice from Hollywood celebrities.
It’s not you and it’s not about you, @july_html .  Over the years, I’ve done more than a few things that left smoldering craters; some you won’t hear about in the news, and some that may or may not have played a small part in what you’re hearing about now.  I can’t dumb down my resume, or try to behave less capable, because it’s impossible to hide that level of experience.  I’m sure you’ve felt a similar frustration in the past, at least once.
So to answer your question, I think it’s a great idea to become a developer.  This world is yours for the taking… never settle for less!Hello or Good evening @cyberluddite
Thank you for your answer and your lighting on situations that you seem to know.
I apologize for answering you late.
I am thinking of finding a solution to keep moving forward in my life.
I am aware of not being ‘compliant’ and less usual than some.
However, I always won long contracts immediately. I adapted to the positions where I worked.
I brought my experience as a person who worked in different professional circles.
I agree with you. Those who recruit want ‘compliance’, more go-anywhere. Which is not pejorative.
Every day, we see the ravages of such a ‘norm’.
In Europe, in my country, unemployment is created by this lack of diversity.
All the same, all in the same wagons of education and diplomas that always lead to the same models, careers, projects, architectures, habits of consumption, pollution …
I think that at all ages, from whatever horizons we come from, we can learn from each other and have everything to gain by diversifying, making exceptions of new proposals, dealing with needs .
Too few people take the time to read, understand, see what is not written in a resume.

You are never to old to learn how to create something new. Being able to transfer your vision on to website is nothing short of amazing!
Forget about working for some cheeky young bloke that doesn’t have half the experience as you. Take your skills and build your own thing! Don’t use your skills to make someone else money. Use it to grow your own online business.
This lady does and she’s 67: https://wpbuildingblocks.com 20
Carpe Diem!Good morning @july_html!  Hopefully your week has been successful, life has been busy here as well.  The “little” website looks interesting so far, keep going with it!
The great thing about the world today is that limits don’t really exist anymore.  You can network anywhere in the world, from anywhere in the world, to anywhere in the world, even while you sleep.  Everyone has the same basic building blocks and opportunities, it’s just a matter of putting the pieces together and making it work.
@rootbeer7’s got the right idea: be your own boss, you’ll make more money from cutting out the middleman… and you won’t have to put up with other people’s misguided judgments.
10 years ago, I left my full-time intern reference librarian job (good pay, great benefits, stable work schedules) as a consequence of the economic crash.  Since then, I’ve run a small publishing and design company, a woodcrafting company, and a few other small gigs… and I currently run an online affiliate adult novelties store.
They’re not the only things I do, or were doing at the time, but the world’s changed.  It’s no longer about the strongest, but the smartest who survive… if they’re crazy enough to take the ultimate challenge.
I’ve never regretted being my own boss and calling my own shots, even when I didn’t have a dime to my name or a couch to sleep on.  You have the knack, you have the desire, you have the experience, and you’ve got everything you need.
Go for it… you’ve got this.Hello @cyberluddite
Thank you for your support.
The motivation will come back and then it will go ! All my desire to learn, seen everywhere are useless in front of people who brake four irons!
I am tired of being prevented from going forward and having to wait for employment services that have taken me through unnecessary information meetings to training to prepare for entry into training.  
A crazy thing that was useless and where I did not learn anything.
A waste of time, without interest.
I have tried and tested everything that is set up by the administrations because I have no choice to do otherwise.
Concrete for the youngest and wind for those of my age.
Registration, forms, papers … And nothing !
I’m going to fend for myself.
On me, I can count because when I start something, I like to finish it, to master it.
No promises, no postponement, a next assignment …
A few years ago I had a business with someone but the original idea was not good, profitable.
And congratulations for your dreams!Good evening @ rootbeer7
I like Wordpress too ! 
The only thing that sinks me is the doubt of being able to acquire a sufficient mastery of the security to be able to concretize my new professional life, what I want to make of it.
and go somewhere else !
I want to work with people from all walks of life and from all walks of life. To discover new perspectives, to learn and to realize projects, ideas, to concretize them.
Thank you for your support.
I’m going to look at this lady’s site.
There is the Wordpress community, very active and very competent to train as well and find answers to questions.

That’s how I started !
One of my sons had told me the link … and after I managed !I am 54 years old  woman and I still love learning  new things - Data Science just now -  with Codecademy. It  is the best play in my life. I hope we give advice and we will show young people that we can  exist in the IT world. Best wishes for You and for older fellows.:-))I have to say that some of this commentary here is quite ageist, though not surprising at all. Also, it’s illegal for companies to discriminate on the basis of age (check EEOC and ADEA), even though it’s difficult to prove when it happens, but, unfortunately it does still happen.
All I can say is, keep learning! Build a portfolio by creating projects or apps, find your community/people, maybe start a blog about coding and apply to everything. I wish you luck! Also you virtually have no shot getting a good job in data science unless you have a masters degree.  I have seen devs with 8 years experience ■■■■■ saying they can’t find work in that field.  So ya I dont know if you want data science unless your a statistics mutant and love mathDon’t let others define your success. The one great thing about coding is that you can create your own experience. I’m in finance, you can’t get experience in this industry by sitting down at a computer in your home. I have so many things I want to explore through code I get frustrated not being able to do it yet. But I am patient and continue on…you can’t know where your journey will end before you’ve taken the first step. "

and I need to google it.
Back in my Childhood at the age of 5 I sit in front of the Commodore Amiga and could handle it better then my older sisters and better then the rest of my fam.
At the age of 8 or 9 I saw the movie Hackers and I was hooked. This is what I want in the future…
In 2012 I started to study Computer Science at the University… but after 1.5 years I had no money for it anymore…  so I quit sadly… and now after serveral years after Army some bullsh*t Jobs and
after my 2 year training as a druggist.
Worked there for 1 year in the company. Poached by another company. Made market manager there. In 3 months a market was completely built up, I was brought back by my old company. Now after a year where I was about to burn out. The company wants to get rid of me at all costs.
You give everything and you get nothing.
I finally started with Coding my old passion.
Started with Python and the Computer Science course.
The first lessons are pretty good but now… the real challenge begins.
I stuck at Lists and Loops  … sometimes I dont understand how should I solve this problem.
After I press view solution… I can understand the Code… most of the time.
I hate it when I press the button because I dont know how can I solve the problem…
to be continued…Thanks for sharing your story @netsurfer71577! Sounds like you’re on the right track to doing what’s meaningful to you. 
For what’s it’s worth, Python is not easy! But hang in there– reread instructions, rerun your code, and ask for help when you need it.
You got this.Thank you so much.
Yes, at the moment I just rerun the Lists and Loops and reread this stuff.
I enjoy it 
Hopefully coding will lead me into a new Job and a better one.Keep going!!!   I think sometimes there’s too much emphasis on working EVERYTHING out yourself when learning, , especially in the early stages and it can be demotivating. Some people learn best by being shown and eventually seeing how it’s done correctly, again and again, will train your brain to see the correct answer for yourself.just keep on track, we are learners here.Hey there people like you motivate me.  I am 32 years old and I feel like I woke up in a nightmare losing my poker dealer job and World Series of poker being cancelled.  I actually have been on and off studying code for probably 8 years now but more than ever I am taking it serious.  I actually even applied to codeacademy lol.  Good job and Keep on keeping onI am in my early 40ish and I am recycling my-self from the “business” after 15 years without writing any line. Just follow your passion never is late.

Chillax, I ain’t going to yell at nobody, just wanted to scare you a little. You know how a lot of people say that the sky’s the limit. Well, why is there even a limit? What happened to large impact of innovation that can be helped by globalization? If the sky really is the limit, even if it is a large one, we’l never be able to go past it once we’ve reached it! But that’s not what I’m here for; I’m here because I have another story to tell. So, I’m halfway through my course and I love hearing what everyone has to say with like the little videos that you get with people who’ve made it big in the industry. So I’m Working and Working (I spent a lot of time, hence the capital W), and I find that I get a headache. It’s unbearable, and I can’t even think straight anymore. I tell myself it’s just from staring too long at the screen, and I’m thinking, am I going to do any permanent damage? Coding is one of the fastest evolving industries in the world, but at what cost? We’ve all heard that watching TV/screens are bad for us, so why do we use this way to code? I know there are a lot of ways that eyestrain can be reduced but this got me thinking; are there other ways we can code? Say write code down and then feed it into a PC, and it reads the code? Has anyone heard of such inventions?  I feel like they would give people a chance to experience, say it with me, the long, lost art, of handwriting. Also, while such an idea would take a long time, can it be processed faster. Or another similar but more efficient idea can may even be saying the code out loud, and a computer just analyzes what you are saying. Or maybe even condensing code into a few buttons that you can press that carry on your device The thing about coding is that the possibilities are endless, so there’s nothing that your imagination can’t accomplish. And for the record, I know pigs can’t fly, but we have to reevaluate in some situations what we believe is possible, redefine our… definitions of what we’re able to do. I’m not saying pigs should fly, I’m saying that this is the answer we should give to people who think that there are limits. Read the title again for me. Acknowledge that you are ignorant to the fact that pigs can’t fly, that’s the way to approach frustration and a lack of motivation from constantly learning. Only then, can we see what is invisible to out eye, what we see and what we know of the world, but clear in our mind’s eyes.


 giga2095771915:

I find that I get a headache. It’s unbearable, and I can’t even think straight anymore.


Oh man, I feel you. To all the people who code: TAKE BREAKS. Breaks are super important, whether you’re learning in front of a screen or with a book. Don’t sit for too long, exercise a bit. Distract, do something else you like. Give your brain some time to refresh, then you can come back, find new perspectives and just keep going.



 giga2095771915:

Say write code down and then feed it into a PC, and it reads the code?


Well there used to be something called punch cards…a long time ago, when programming was still starting out. I’m guessing there was a reason why we didn’t keep on using them 
I mean, writing the code in our computer, now we have specialized IDEs that help us with detecting syntax errors, we have autocomplete, etc. I don’t think we would have those advantages if we wrote code in a paper. Writing code manually and feeding it into a computer would also have its cons anyways. Can you imagine having to write 1000 lines of code manually? Man, my wrist would be screwed 
I like that you came up with other new ways to code, though. But, in my very humble and personal opinion, I’d keep coding in my computer and learn to take good care of my health 


 giga2095771915:

We’ve all heard that watching TV/screens are bad for us, so why do we use this way to code?


Same reason we have miners ruining their lungs, and office workers destroying their backs and cardiovascular health sitting at a desk: it’s the way society works and we need money for food and shelter. You can only hope that some people do their jobs also because they like them.



 giga2095771915:

Say write code down and then feed it into a PC, and it reads the code?


Very impractical. Any reasonably functional and useful piece of software will have thousands of lines of code. Not something you want to write by hand. But technically you can. With OCR you can translate your handwriting to typed text.



 giga2095771915:

the long, lost art, of handwriting.


Tell that to anyone under 22 going to school days. I think we all have all fair share of handwriting and I haven’t met anyone that doesn’t know how to write by hand yet.



 giga2095771915:

Or another similar but more efficient idea can may even be saying the code out loud, and a computer just analyzes what you are saying


You mean like when you ask Siri/Alexa/Google for the weather? or to make a reminder for later? Can you imagine what it would be like to dictate code outloud? “Start a function called count primes. It takes 1 parameters with name num. Inside the function define a variable called all primes and initialize to an empty array…” It would take forever to code anything! And what’s going to happen to your voice after doing that 40 hours a week? And can you do that next to your coworkers while the do their own dictation?



 giga2095771915:

Or maybe even condensing code into a few buttons that you can press that carry on your device


We’ve done that. It’s called a keyboard. Computers have big ones and smartphones and other smaller devices have them in short form with touch screens. You can press this buttons to do code.



 giga2095771915:

And for the record, I know pigs can’t fly





 giga2095771915:

I’m saying that this is the answer we should give to people who think that there are limits.


With enough thrust, anything can fly. A fridge can fly, your bed can fly! Don’t constraint yourself here. Easiest way would probably be with large balloons, but the knowledge is largely available online to calculate needed thrust based on weight for a quad-copter for example. Take those material requirements to a workshop with a CNC and get cracking!

Are you trying to say we should be humble but approach anything with a scientific method of probably doubt? I’m with you then. Study a problem, craft a theory, test it, analyze the outcome, and start over again


 irlfede:

Are you trying to say we should be humble but approach anything with a scientific method of probably doubt?


Yes, so nice to see that you agree!!! I guess being humble would mean that we don’ think we’re beter than anybody or make anybody feel differently because we have different opinions, but ya studying a problem and coming to a conclusion on what to do next is what I meant.



 irlfede:

We’ve done that. It’s called a keyboard. Computers have big ones and smartphones and other smaller devices have them in short form with touch screens. You can press this buttons to do code.


Love the “We’ve done that”. Also, feel like i momentarily forgot about the invention of the greatest thing known to humanity (OK, one of the greatest things), the keyboard. But ya, this was just me spewing out idea, nothing realy thought about. The whole post was really me saying, are here other ideas we can use to solve a specific problem? But ya.

This is just sad. I hadn’t realized how much of an impact that there was beyond just coding. We really need to find some solutions for things. Like, (again, just spewing ideas, even if they may be bad):  Better sysytems, healthcare coverage (I mean, I’m not sure if they’d get benefits though), special masks??But anyways, thank you for your informational comments are of taking the time to read my post!

Yeesh, that seems like a bit of a risky bet. I’d imagine you covered it in the bet, but how about Sublime?
It is certainly more difficult to use notepad, though not impossible. I think I rely on error messages more than my text editorIt’ll get worse before it gets better. Be optimistic! Oh man. That’s why I don’t bet Yeah, Sublime Text was also covered. In fact, every IDE and text editor (except Notepad) was covered. Even Notepad++ is better than Notepad.

If not, what additional resources did you need to land a job?This is a great question!  I can’t wait to see the responses Define a career?  I know someone that used it specifically to gain some knowledge to get an apprenticeship as a Software Dev.  It was also an apprenticeship that didn’t require any previous knowledge.  That said having knowledge would have made him a stronger candidate.  So not sure if you’d count that.I don’t know anyone who did, but I’d say that it’s very unlikely. There are just too many complex and advanced topics not covered in Codecademy courses. Of course, they have created many, many PRO courses for certain languages and lots of interesting Skill Paths, and in that case I’d say there might be a handful of people who were able to get somewhere with just that, but in general it would appear to me that you’d need lots of actual coding time, several learning sources, and be very skilled at googling and looking things up on stackoverflow to be able to land an entire career.A good mechanic never credits his tools, but neither do they ever blame them.  Any skill is learned by doing. A chef with years in the kitchen can still mess up a soufle or a poached egg, even.
Some people through their own drive will acquire employment after taking courses offered here. They are driven, and came with the right attitude going forward. They deserve to succeed and they will.
Paid for or not, this is not a meal ticket and nor is it handed to us on a plate. If we don’t WANT IT, then it is all just tinker toys.I am presently working as a software engineer at a major bank.
I got lots of useful instruction and practice in various languages here on Codecademy with paid pro_ subscription.
I also have a math degree, experience as a network engineer in the Army, and an affinity for computing since childhood.This doesn’t quite count but while I was completing the Python3 Codecademy course I received a the google foo.bar 36 challenge which I sadly failed since I had not acquired the necessary skills to become a full python dev.No way an experienced chef mess up a poached egg or souffle trust me       Good of you to refute that suggestion!  How about the other 98 ways to cook an egg?it was not my intention to refute what you said was just to play down  
That’s the difference between a chef who knows how to do cook an egg and a programmer who never stop learning new thing…                  ~YOUR TOWNSHIP CHEF   


 ruby4753151008:

Yet the statement did just that. It’s not a bad thing; ergo, I thanked you. That was not facetious, but genuine.
We learn from our mistakes, that much is assumed. Mess up scrambled eggs and yer arse is grass, but, we get the chance to do it again. A chef and a programmer are not that far apart. They both go on to crack another egg.I absolutely agree with the important thing and learn from your mistakes and don’t fall back on them in programming as in anything else.
here i come with another question does anyone think is possible to land a tech job without even a college/medium school/diploma? not talking about high educationYes. There are provisos. Any talent seeker will be able to spot diamonds in the rough. Some still get missed, so must shine through on their own motivation.Nice to hear that a was a bit wonder i had to get back to college so lost another two years into it… Even in isolation we can draw on the internet. Using CC or other MOOCs lets us do that along a planned path. There’s stuff to pick up along the way in any regard. Learners who determine their aim and stay with it to some resolve keep progressing. Things like doubt, boredom and/or distractions can derail the learning process. Learners know they are up against this and fight past it.Hello sholomkeller,
At the moment I am a network engineer and trying to transition into a software engineer role. I have no experience coding at the moment but I’m willing to learn. How did you manage to make the transition?Codecademy doesn’t even hire people who pay for their product lol …  no I have never seen someone get a job on this alone. If they did extremely lucky or it wasn’t requiring experience.  Every software developer I know right now who has a job went to a good college.  And no people I don’t want to hear you made 5,000 on upwork last year lol.  I mean a job over 100,000 students coming out of top colleges are going to get the best jobs.  This field is so saturated right now and impossible for people like me who don’t have college computer science degrees.If they don’t have your imagination then they can’t fill your place.Zucherburg stole FB from his friends.

Steps to Reproduce: Change the number of apples and oranges to an “incorrect” number.
The third section of the interface (webpage with visual display) does not show the correct number of apples and oranges if an “incorrect” number of fruits is inputted (by incorrect, I mean one that is not what Codecademy has instructed you to input).
For example, setting apple = 5, then apple = apple + 2, does not display 7 apples (same with oranges). Other numbers will also cause the incorrect number of fruits to be displayed or none at all. This was first brought up in the post below.




FAQ: Operators - Putting it All Together General Coding FAQ


    Just curious if there’s something wrong with this exercise. I wanted to play around with the variables a bit so I did the following: 
apple = 5 
apple = apple + 2   (this should resolve to 7 apples) 
orange = 5 
orange = orange - 2 (this should resolve to 3 oranges) 
I get one apple and zero orange. There must be some max number limit or the interface is buggy?

And how many have found jobs with just this course alone?You are more likely to find and internship than a job, it is very rare that a company has the resources to pay someone so they can learn. There are a lot more things you need to learn aside from writing the code and making an app work.Hi @corerunner25892,  I’m planning on starting a career freelancing after the course, so I can definitely let you know how it goes! You might find this article useful: https://blog.stoneriverelearning.com/how-to-make-money-while-you-learn-to-code/ 32
@peachesmotorsports could you be more specific please about what other “things” one would need to learn to start freelancing?If you’re going to be a freelancer, most likely you’re going to be working by yourself so you need to learn how to do everything required to successfully complete and maintain a project (you don’t want your customer to go away when you’re done).
Project Management
This is greatly underestimated, people in this profession don’t pay enough attention to this. You need to take ambiguous requirements from your customer and turn them into something they want, which most of the time they don’t know or they can’t convey it properly.

Wireframes\sketches\designs are a must. The customer says they want something, you code it and say it’s done! The customer sees it and realizes that’s not really what they wanted. You have to do it again. You’re wasting your time, and you’re wasting their time. While you’re at it, your losing money because you gave them a quote based on an estimate, and now it’s going to take longer because you have to redo half the app.
Proper effort estimation. You will give them a quote based on your estimated effort to complete a project, if you don’t estimate properly you’re going to lose money and potentially not have a good reference from said customer. The effort needs to consider QA, rework, deployment, etc.
The Agile framework is very powerful, but just because you put sticky notes on your wall doesn’t mean your Agile. You need to learn how to use the framework properly to optimize your work and give visibility to your customer.

You also need to review the whole project with the customer: what is their end goal, who is their customer, what is the best platform for the intended purpose? Just because you learned how to do an app with Angular doesn’t mean you can do every single project handed to you with Angular. Some projects require a mobile app, even if it’s an app you need to decide if you need network connectivity or not, analyze device requirements, bandwidth requirements, 2-factor auth, sync with other services, data backup, Android vs iOS, etc. Some projects need Angular, others need Python, others can be done with just Node. If it’s an app you’ll need JAVA, XCODE, maybe ReactJS. If it needs to support Android, iOS AND a website, maybe Vue is the best option.
You need to be flexible with technology. Otherwise, you’re limiting the projects you can take on or you’re potentially making your life very difficult by only using 1 framework.
Environments
You finished the app and the customer approved. Great! Now what? You need to deploy it.

Where? Azure, AWS, Heroku, Wordpress, your own server?
Are you setting up a Windows server? Linux server? Or do you want to use Kubernetes?
Who is going to do that, you?
How much does all of that cost to do and maintain month to month, year to year? Did you tell your customer about it?
You need to deploy an update, V1.3. Did you properly plan the downtime? Did you test the updates to the db schema so you don’t affect the existing data?
You launched the app, it crashed. Who’s going to fix it and when? Can you do that while you’re on vacation in Europe?
Your customer’s client found a bug you missed, when do you fix it? Did you include that in your budget? You’re working on another project already, do you have time?

Code Quality

Do you have a QA resource? Can’t afford it? Then you need to learn how to properly QA your code.
The regression cycle takes to long? You need to add automation to the pipeline. Who’s going to write it?
The app started to run very slowly after a few months of being in production, can you analyze the load on the service? Does the server need more CPU? Do you have a memory leak? Do you need to optimize your API calls?

This is not all there is to it, there are other things to consider.
This post is not meant to scare you away, all these things can be learned but it takes time and experience. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen or heard of a course that teaches you any of this. My guess is because most companies do a half-■■■ job and don’t care because they make it work, even when they lose money. I have seen bad practices, and I have seen good practices. Companies or people that have good practices are few and far in between. I am by no means an expert, I’ve have to deal with a lot of bad practices and try to do the best I can in my position.Absolutely amazing post! Thank you for sharing such a detailed post . I am sure it has given perspective to many people like me.I am working with Alyssa on a Q&A session for questions like this, I suggested we can use freelancing as the first item to discuss. Like I said, those are only a f ew items.Just to ask further if suppose we want to enter into freelancing what should be our action plan?I can make some notes on this specificallyWe are having a Q&A on freelancing, discussing this in more detail. Sign up here: https://www.codecademy.com/events/codecademy-and-you-freelancing-pablo-chois 25If you missed the first session, you can find a recording here 14. Session 2 is scheduled for next week.Thank you very much for the discourage ! If you say so , the codeacademy is not a right place for beginners like me… I have just started 5 days ago, let me get my money back from the codeacademy.Why are you discouraged, because the Codecademy course doesn’t teach you every single thing you need to be a freelancer? No course out there does that, if someone actually makes that claim it is most likely a lie. If I were to dedicate 100% of my time to teach someone how to be a successful freelancer it would be very expensive, and it would take a very long time.
Any course, whether it’s here or anywhere else, only teaches you how to do things. If you want to master something you need experience and you only get that by working and using what you learned.
You’re going to have to keep learning for as long as you stay in this field. It never stops. I’ve been doing this for close to 12 years and I’m still taking courses about different things, on Codecademy and other sites. I also learn things on my own.
If you’re looking for an easier way, there isn’t one. The support you get from this community is hard to find, the same goes for the quality of the courses.He does have a point. CodeCademy severely lacks focus on the point of WHERE and HOW to find a job after you’ve done their courses. Being condescending to him, is sure not gonna help or encourage him either.I’m not being condescending, if I was I would straight up call him an idiot which I haven’t done at any point. You don’t know me, so you don’t know how straight I am with people. I have been fired from jobs because I call people out on bad ideas, bad strategies, and bad management policies. It is a bad trait to have in this or any profession.
I am, in fact, being extremely open about the struggles I’ve faced. Problems nobody helped me with. I don’t have all the answers and I’m not always right, if I don’t have a good answer then I have no problem with saying I don’t’ know. The last thing I do is talk out of my ■■■ trying to sound superior to someone else, I’ve never been that person and I’ve quit jobs when said people are the ones calling the shots so I am offended by your comment. I gain absolutely nothing by talking down to people. I’m a big boy though, so I’ll survive.
What I do have is experience with what doesn’t work, and I share tips on how to avoid those problems so people in this community can have an easier time finding success. Being successful in this profession is not easy, everybody needs to understand that.
I don’t work for Codecamy so I don’t have any benefit from posting things here. I don’t know what are all the services or courses they offer, but I do know they have resources where they show people how to find a job and how to prepare for interviews. Why am I so sure? Because I was part of those virtual sessions. Where are all the recordings and how do you access them? I don’t know, ask one of the admins.Hi all. Everyone here is working to learn, and it can feel completely overwhelming, so it makes sense that we always want to be as encouraging as possible, @core6567601191.
That said, @peachesmotorsports is a very open book always willing to share, and that’s a valuable trait in any community, so I feel super lucky to have met peaches. 
For more videos on all the peripheral stuff, check out our YouTube channel 5 where we have lots of recordings.@peachesmotorsports is absolutely right from what I find. I currently spend about 12 to 15 hours a week learning and that’s just the core knowledge. From my experience going from a Chef to testing and writing code for a medical company remotely has taught me that no site can teach you everything about how to “work” in the field and how to “get a job.” From SQL and Application management programs, to terminology, to communication with GitHub (which can be very confusing if you don’t have experience), to server management specifications, HIPAA compliancy (if that’s what you do) and the expectations to deliver while explaining what you did to people who have no idea what you are talking about.
Most of all, no company or school can teach you patience and how to think on your feet. @peachesmotorsports is absolutely right in Project Management. I believe the only reason I went from Freelancing at the company I am at now to out right hired is because of my Project Management experience from being an Executive Chef in Chicago for 10 years, as they had no Project Management in place before I arrived.
So, from my actual experience in freelancing/remote in regards to getting an actual job that will pay you money for work, taking the advice in this thread should be heavily considered.To find the best work, you really need to establish a broader team.  If you would rather spend time coding apps and websites and less time dealing directly with the customer or client, then link up with a Product Owner / AM / Business PM type.  If neither of you are very good at getting new deals, connect with a sales hunter.  Each person in your team can certainly also be a Freelance agent but having a team is helpful."
342,Welcome to CS101: A livestreamed introduction to Computer Science,Tips and Resources,0,87,"I just wanted to drop this here in case you haven’t heard. It is an awesome introduction series for anyone new to computer science or looking to revisit programming foundations! Here’s the link and the info:
CS101: A livestreamed introduction to Computer Science 5

2000×840 56.4 KB
Join us for a semester-long intro to Computer Science! Over the course of the next 8 weeks, we’ll be hosting a live web series covering fundamental topics in Computer Science.
Our Curriculum Developers will introduce you to CS fundamentals, including how to think like a programmer. You’ll solve coding challenges and learn how to build basic programs in Python. We’ll be streaming live on  Tuesdays at 1pm ET from September 1 through October 20.
The content of CS101 Live is similar to what you might see in the first few months of your first college semester in Computer Science. We’ll be working in Python. However, the content we’ll cover is fundamental to almost every programming language.
How to Watch
Every Tuesday at 1pm ET, we’ll be streaming our weekly session to YouTube 1, Twitch, Twitter, and Facebook. These sessions will run for approximately 1 hour.
You can find more information about each week’s session on the Codecademy Events Page 1. Register through the individual event pages to get an email reminder and mark it on your calendar so you don’t forget. We’ll also be updating this blog post with each week’s session after it happens so you can catch up on anything you miss.
Syllabus
Each week, we will be completing a module from our CS101 Course 1. This is a Pro course that has been specifically created for this livestream series. The stream will be free to everyone, but to code along with us, you’ll have to be a Codecademy Pro or Pro Student member.  Find out more about the discounted Codecademy Pro Student membership in our  Student Center.
We also recommend looking through the module ahead of time so you can come to the stream prepared to ask questions.

343,Releasing: Codecademy Cheat Sheets,Community,23,12.8k,"NEW - Cheat Sheets
From Today’s newsletter:
Growing up, we had to memorize the spelling of words like “return,” remember that 12 x 12 = 144, and recall the conjugations of  tener . Coding is not so different, having to memorize specific syntax, rules, and commands. And in coding, you’ll get an error if you misspell  return , so it’s important to remember the details.
But coding should be less about rote memorization and more about understanding the principles at work. So to help you focus more on deeper understanding, we created Codecademy Cheat Sheets.
You can refer to a Cheat Sheet when you’re building your next project or querying a new data set. We also made them downloadable as PDFs, so you can take them with you anywhere.
We currently have cheat sheets for the following courses:

Learn C++ 442
Introduction to HTML 971
Introduction to JavaScript 1.1k
Learn Java 459
Learn Python 3 1.5k

More to come in the future. You’ll find them at the end of each relevant lesson.@zainabrawat this is great. here is the a list btw: (updated)

 This is so beautiful Hi there,
Thank you so much for sharing these. However, it looks like this list is incomplete? For example, the JavaScript course has lessons on arrays, loops, iterators etc. but there are no cheat sheets available for these lessons. Are they still perhaps being worked on?
Some clarification on this would be great.
Thanks again.Hi,
I’m not sure about the cheat sheets, @sonnynomnom will have to update.



 hanz64:

has lessons on arrays, loops


these are also mentioned in the Javascript Glossary:
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/glossary-javascript 77This is a beta feature right now. Suppose people really enjoy the cheat sheets and believe this should be a feature, then we are going to go back in, iterate on it on the product side and create more of them.
So make sure to let us know what you think in the survey linked in the Cheat Sheets.Hi. Where are there cheat sheets for only the first four lessons of Learn Python 3? Why are there not cheat sheets for the rest of the lessons in that course? Maybe there are, but I can’t find them? Thank you for your help!Hi,

Looking forward to matplotlib and seaborn cheat sheets!Hi,
I was wondering what the copyright restrictions are on the cheatsheets. Am I able to share them with people at my workplace?
Other learn to code websites publish them openly for anyone to use. Will Codecademy be doing the same in the future?I wanna confirm with @sonnynomnom on copyright restrictions but you can definitely share these with your colleagues.yep, you can def share them! also, we are working on Cheatsheets 2.0   So more are coming in the next two, three months!Hi again, please keep them coming, these are super useful especially for those of us that like to make our own notes for easy review.
One gripe I have is that why are these cheat sheets not yet given a dedicated page somewhere on the codecademy site? I’m having to google “cheat sheets” just to find them, that’s not right… They should be easily accessible via the main page of the site (perhaps consider placing a “cheat sheet” link under the “Resources” section found at the bottom of the codecademy homepage).what about CSS  why there is no cheat sheets ?good to know! working on it~  @hanz64css def coming soon!Awesome!  Please keep them coming.
Thank youPlease keep updating cheat sheet for python since cheatsheet is really useful when revision.Can I get C# cheatsheet?There’s  a spelling error in the Intro to JavaScript cheatsheet 6

344,How to get motivated,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,784,"I suggest to find out if you have motivation, look at things in your life that you’re already motivated to do. In other words, what do you do every day that takes no effort to start doing? You wake up and you do it the first thing. And you do it everyday without fail!
That’s the energy you need for programming. If that’s hard to come by then I suggest you think on a “project” level instead of a “coding” student level. List 5 things you wish were better in your life? List 5 things you wish were better in the world? Take those 5 things (or 10 things) and write a short paragragh for each describing what it means to you and how you want to be a part of this awesome thing you really like. After that, of those 10 things, which one really grabs your mind and interest.
Take that one thing, and start sketching an app or website that explores this one thing. To sketch, use Powerpoint, or Keynote, or Illustrator or paper and pencil/markers. Map out ideas for this “one thing you love” and map out visuals for webpages or how it looks on a smart phone screen.
Map out each screen and specifically what each screen webpage communicates to the user. Use colorful designs, images, drawings, text…it’s an art project, basically!
If you can accomplish that, then you’re ready to go with programming because programming is just a means to accomplish your bigger, better, real-life dream: that ONE THING you love and want to do or communicate to the world.Even though this post is from months ago, it should be brought to the forefront because many learners (including myself) get stuck at the “I finished the HTML/CSS courses so… now what” stage.
Your post is a great starting point to continuing practice through DOING something with the knowledge. Combining technical know-how with creative vision isn’t an easy task, especially with a new skill like coding. It’s akin to the frustration of having a great idea but not having the skill to execute the idea exactly the way you imagined it.
Coding is iterative, never permanent. It’s a fluid, messy process of trial and error. This is a hard pill to swallow for perfectionists like myself who want everything to be perfect the first time.
I will give your project idea a try. It might be the crappiest website you’ve ever seen, but it’s SOMETHING, and that’s what matters."
345,What was your win this week?,Random,9,113,"What was your win for the week? It can be coding related or not!

Did you learn something new?
Did you start a 30 Day coding challenge?
Did you help someone else? Maybe provide feedback to their project?

Excited to hear about everyone’s win(s)! I continued my coding streak and am at day 97. 
I am starting on the ML part of the DS course.  I’ll need to review some math concepts while doing this though b/c I’m a little rusty. 
I thought of a new personal project idea too that could involve Koalas (based on Pandas) https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest
 
Non-coding: Going to make some pumpkin-pecan bread or muffins.I had a big win this week. I now have the longest streak I’ve ever had until now: 19 days. I mean, it’s nothing compared to your 97-day streak, but I feel really good about it 
I’ve been learning to discipline myself and focus and work on what I have to do…then, I can go and work on whatever I want to. Aka stop procrastinating 
Non-coding related, I finally found some songs I had never been able to find from my favorite movie (aka Into The Spider-verse). They’re this one 1 and this one, in case someone’s wondering lol.I finally decided it was safe enough to resume jiujitsu classes. Great way to get back into shape What, no baking this week??  Oh, jeez.
I imagine that’s how I’ll feel after I start running again.  Haha, glad you remembered 
I actually baked some apple and cinnamon muffins, and let me tell ya, those were the BEST ones I’ve baked until now. For some reason buying an oats flour at the supermarket instead of making my own oats flour made a really big difference lol.
And tomorrow I’m gonna bake cookies Finished 6% of Web Dev Learning Track, so I’m on speed for 30day challenge.
The sad part of this is this all I’m able to complete without Pro.  I didn’t realize this, so I’m trying to find a different way. Wish me luck Now Pro and continuously learning - THANK YOU!"
346,Codecademy is cool,Random,5,90,"Honestly I’m new here, and it’s quick and easy to learn!Wanna share some of your favorite things about it?Sure, it’s really easy to start, it doesn’t pressure you to buy pro all the time (although I recommend it), and  it actually can teach you a lot.Have you come across any of the Cheat Sheets? I think they are super useful!Yeah, they really are."
347,I have a question about the computer science carrer path cheatsheets,Community,3,52,"After point 12, sorting, of the computer science career path there are no more cheatsheets, and I wonder if they are just not available yet or they are not going to be made.I couldn’t say for certain so hopefully someone else can answer your query but if you like having a cheatsheet then I think the best option would be creating your own as you progress through these lessons. This could be as simple as a pen and paper notes or you could do something in a text file or maybe something more advanced. Apologies that doesn’t directly answer your question but I think it might be a viable alternative.The Computer Science Path’s units can be found in similar courses also offered on Codecademy, so you can find the cheatsheets for those courses. I’ve compiled a list of the possible related cheatsheets below for your convenience (I don’t know the exact course contents since I do not have PRO).

Learn Python 3 1
Learn the Command Line
Learn Git
Linear Data Structures
Learn Complex Data Structures
Learn Recursion with Python
Learn Sorting Algorithms with Python
How to Implement Search Algorithms with Python
Learn Data Visualization with Python
There aren’t any new methods introduced from what I remember. I feel it was more concept/project oriented. You should keep a copy of the projects you complete as they serve as good references (including the helper files to make your script run)."
348,Remote Job,30-Day Challenge,4,206,"what is ur opinion guys about remote job ?
and list some sites where we can get recruit for remote jobRemote work is very convenient for people who need it or know how to take advantage of it, but you should know that people who work from home usually work more than 40 hours a week. Even when you take a break whenever you feel like it or run a quick errand, you end up working more. I tell you this because I work more than 40 hours per week and a recent study from Microsoft during the pandemic confirms it.
I don’t know if there is a specific site for remote jobs, you need to be resourceful and look around. Go to any job site and look for a “remote” filter.https://weworkremotely.com/ 24 is a site/job board I’ve followed for a while

352,"A Story To Share, An Identity To Find",Corner Bar,0,93,"So, I’ve been on this forum for a few days and noticed that I didn’t see a lot of people talking about their personal development regarding a specific stereotype they may have experienced/other challenges. For example, I thought I see maybe more women talking about how they realized that they were never destined for the kitchen, amid many stereotypes, or even anyone elderly celebrating how they’re able to be more appealing to their grand kids. I barely do assume thing a lot for the time, but this time, I will. I am going to assume that such stories do not appear anywhere because

People are too shy to write about their accomplishments or don’t think they’ve done anything worthy of mentioning
Are being discouraged by those around them, and don’t seem to care about their accomplishments, so why should others?
Have no idea this forum even exists, in which case, I really didn’t realize until now, how these people may feel lacking a community and even feel discouraged because of this. In that case, we need a strategy to help people figure out this place even exists! Because guess what? I get it, why should I care if other people are able to join or not? I get that’s something that may be at the back of our mind, but this place… it’s an entire identity that has been formed by hundreds, so letting more people know of the support and source of well-being this may be for them can only impact each other as well. But we’ll get back to that to that later, because looking back to the first problem, how can you find a voice when you don’t know what makes up your identity? Is it your friends, you thoughts, or the deafening silence you find when you need that helping hand? Perhaps you are an independent learner, and that’s how you learn best. How are you supposed to share your voice? A lot of the times, we underestimate the power of putting our thoughts and experiences into words, and how some people may not even have that ability. Are you dyslexic and trying to learn coding? Or struggle to typing? Is talking into a mic more your style? Being shy to state your voice can meaning helping those who can’t find their voice, share theirs. Challenges and uphill battles will always exist, so don’t make everyday the same old, because there’s more to life. Conquering shyness will always have been the best thing you got out of it. After all, what’s so bad with endless support and a platform to share your experiences?

Now, the next problem. Let me get  this straight first: You’re like the best thing that ever happened to me right now. Ya you reader, because you’ve read what I have to say and made it this far, so here’s a thank you. If someone you know thinks that coding is a waste of your time (Seriously, my mom told me once what the point of this… what do you say to that?) But guess what? You know this is the activity for you if even if you feel awkward about talking around people who suddenly clam up because coding is “like…nerdy”, and you ignore that, you know what that is? EMPOWERMENT. Fight for what you like. Forums are a great way to share your beliefs and find people who like what you do as well. Having something in common isn’t the only way to make friends though. Introduce your friends to the world of coding, maybe even tie their interests in. If that person still doesn’t budge, well, what can you do? You have the power to change the world in your hands. Try thinking that way. Change you’re perspective, and then tell me what you’re able to come and find. You’ll be surprised to find what you never thought was possible.
I hope I inspired you to share your love of coding (if you are even on the forums and read this), and that you are able to learn from others and reflect on your own experiences. Doing coding by itself is great and all, but reflecting on your journey gives you experience, and cultivate an identity of your own. Not convinced? Well, as a first step, try communicating with those on the comments below. Take a share of you idea of telling your story. Tell what you believe in."
353,What Developing an Interest Should Look Like; Making That Personal Connection and Building a Community,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,85,"You know those 9-to-5 jobs that just seem necessary to survive? Picture this: You wake up in the big city, you’re in your New York apartment, and get ready for the day ahead. You brush your teeth, take a shower, and scan the newspaper before taking your briefcase filled with important papers to your job of the day. You walk into the office, say hello to a few coworkers, and they say hi back, before going to sit at your cubicle. You stare at this empty void and begin to type. You grab a cup of coffee, and that is merely the highlight of your day. (This is my food mention for the day, folks!) When you get back from work, you skip dinner as you’re exhausted, and climb right into bed? Sound familiar to any of you? Maybe not, but this is the type of life a lot may find themselves in, and consider it a sacrifice for a well-paying job. But at what cost? I think coding is a great way that a lot of people are able to learn about their passions, and even redefine what they know about the world. Some tips I would recommend while coding would be finding a project that you really enjoy doing, or even introducing a project at the workplace. This would make your skills stand out even more, and you would be able to not stick to a single routine. Introduce collaboration, overall mental health and well-being even, as a part of whatever you decided to plan. Even if your job has nothing at all that relates to coding, or requires no academic prior knowledge, you can inform those in the community that you work in about your experiences with coding. Share your experiences and develop an understanding that will hep promote your personal brand and interests! How have you shared coding with those in the community that you work in? And if you’re lacking any motivation, I would check out Forbes’s article on Chuck Feeny and his mindset on giving and journey into philanthropy. I know this has almost nothing to do with philanthropy, but I personally thought it was interesting to see how he was able to develop this passion that meant giving up a creating lifestyle, and how he helped inspired others. There are a lot of different ways to define and interest; You can call it a natural talent, something that you just do to pass the time, but either way the commitment and level of respect anyone dedicates to any activity is something that should be admired and more openly shared, together. My story with this particular mission would be helping develop technology endeavors, and funding for such research opportunities as a volunteer. I helped recruit a lot of people to supp rt a cause, and was able to give others the insight they needed to know how to handle the diseases they had and what resources were available to them."
354,Looking for collaborators,Corner Bar,2,378,I’m a young (high school in Australia) but relatively competent programmer looking for collaborators on a project.

355,There’s a New Idea For Teens? No Way!: Course Outline (Pt.2),Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,0,85,"So, I recently made a part 1 of this series with the same title so here’s the second part. Just going to throw around a few ideas here and there of what a course for teens would look like if it ever was designed: Based on my experience with the Code Foundations pathway, I think one of the first lessons should be where users can find information on what to expect as well as different goals that they will be achieving. I chose the Code Foundations Path to base my example off of , because it’s one of the most introductory paths, which is what I’m aiming for this to be.  A long with the introduction, as short lesson or 2 can be included that has the user can use to understand what coding is, with another on different people in history who have made breakthroughs in the industry and shaped what we know about coding and it’s application today. To further reinforce these concepts, the content will be spaced out in chapters/ sections that will improve collaboration, and more. I will space out more of the content, but what I’d really like to see is people being able to work together more, and be taught not only theoretically, but in a more hands on nature, that will improve the overall ability to find an identity and cultivate a space dedicated for such a mission, will help empower each other. Just my topic on a few things, don’t even know if this will be considered at all, but I like writing about this idea anyways, so any feedback/questions/comments, are welcome!"

                Hi there! Welcome to the forums

Hello @nitowl, welcome to the forums! If you pay for PRO, I would recommend taking the Web dev path-even though you know some HTML,CSS and JS, you can just skip over the parts you already know. This paths teaches you each language, and then teaches you how to apply them to making a website. Otherwise, you could just take any course on a specific language that you want to learn.Hi there! Welcome to the forums 
I am Yiz, I am also a teen looking to make programming my career. (Although I’m also into art, writing and chemistry).
I like this little quiz thingy 1 that Codecademy offers you to try and see which languages suit you best. Of course the answer is probably not going to be 100% accurate, but you can at least get an idea.
I started off with Python, which I think is mainly used for Data Science. After that I learned Java, because I got into Android Development (although now, if you wanna get into Android Development, I suggest you learn Kotlin first).
I also know some HTML, CSS and JavaScript, like you. Although I haven’t really put my knowledge to good use yet 
Well I hope all my rambling gave you an idea of where to start lol  
If you ever need help with anything, you can always ask here in the forums, there are plenty of people willing to help @yizuhi
Thank you so much!
I’m not sure about Android Development. I’m more interested in websites and, like, computers… But I’m still not sure about exactly what I want to do, I guess I just want to be able to have as much knowledge as I can, then from there figure out what I want to do. Would that be a bad choice? or? ._.
Oh something I was thinking about doing is, cyber security, what would I have to learn to do that? lol sorry I’m so clueless rn, I defiantly need to do more research hehe.Oh it’s okay.
Yeah figuring out what you wanna do can be daunting…I might be mainly into Android Development just because it’s almost the only thing I know how to do lol 
I have been thinking of getting into data science though, and I’m already learning about Web Development.
Learning as much as you can before knowing what you want to do…I think it’s not a bad idea. Here in Codecademy, most of the time they tell you how you can use what you learned. (And I mean you can also ask the wise guy Google).
That way you can also find new things that interest you, which is great.
The only thing is that sometimes, if you don’t have a clear idea of where you want to go and what you want to achieve, it’s easier to give up and get frustrated along the way. But as long as you can deal with that I think you’ll be okay

360,"Let’s talk about society, because… I’m surprised",Corner Bar,3,104,"This one’s for the believers:
I like relating coding to a lot of the things I encounter in real life, because it helps me learn and apply my knowledge and gain a more through understanding of certain concepts. So here’s one for those who like make-up. I was walking through the mall, sipping on a delicious blueberry Slurpee,(Yes, I’m always eating, and yes, I find it necessary to mention) when I  went to Spehora to go buy my cousin a gift for her birthday. When I went there, I saw a lot of different technologies being used to help people buy what they needed. First, there were those machines that people used to find their exact skin tone colour and match. I thought that was really interesting, since it tied in with technology, but never did I think dermatology could be impacted by evolving tech. The history of tech is what redefines most of what we do, first used in the form of type writes, and other conventional tasks. So bringing technology to benefit women and their choice to wear makeup I thought was a really great idea, because we’ve always supported male domination, of sorts. So making women more aware of the products they use and overall health, I think is a great way we’ve stepped up to responding to a lack of women in STEM and more women empowerment as well. That’s just my take; Anyone else feel like they’re misjudged in anyway be it their race,decisions, or gender? You, my dear friend, are not alone. While we have made an effort to acknowledge these inequalities there’s not much we do about them. Coding should be where it starts.Health and beauty tech have been around since the advent of the 386 CPU. There was finally enough horsepower to do the computing necessary for color recognition, color temperature, shadows and gray scale, and so on. One such product we promoted in the mid 80s was the New Image Salon System.
We could sit you down in front of a camera, feed the image into the program and produce images of your face with any number of hair styles and colors. Once the customer was set on the one they liked, we printed the picture and they took it to their favorite stylist.The nice thing about today’s technology is it is much cheaper owing to scale. Back then, the system I mentioned above would run about 25,000 USD. That included computer, monitors, camera, printer, software license and a five year subscription to monthly issued  new style releases.That’s really informative. I never thought such technologies would have existed or that they would play a part in health and wellness, because it’s a topic that’s more recently been up to date. Making it cheaper, I think, was progressive, as it would be easier to obtain and more people can be aware of the technology"
361,"Coding Isn’t hard, it’s like rocket science!","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",12,230,"That’s the type of response I feel like I’m getting whenever I take the next step in trying to write code. It’s not that I’m a bad coder or lack motivation, after all the word bad in front of any job title, is simply a highlight of your self-esteem. Ok, so this may seem like mind-dumping, or reeking, call it what you will. However, are there really enough resources out here that will help coders… not code but express themselves more in a better way? The lessons on Codecademy, I find are pretty structured, and by that I mean you really do not have much freedom as a beginner. A pro? Well, this person would have the ability to design entire apps, websites, the whole shebang. Is it… their determination? Enthusiasm? I want to know. How does a person who thinks like a computer, tells it what to do, foster enough creativity? As in, the ability to freely highlight an emotion, a risk, a swipe of a angry painter? Emotions, my dear coders, are not something computers have. At what point do both intersect at crossroads? As an app developer or even a beginner coder, you have basic knowledge that you appeal to before going anywhere. In other words, you have the  four wheels  you need to drive that car. But decorating the car… the app developer may have some experience with graphic design, aka the placement of various designs that are aesthetically appealing, but where are the ergonomics? What will give the beginner the same ability to develop an app like a pro? Let me tell you: Say it with me, creativity. To tell you the truth, I do not know much about coding I can make lists, tell the difference between a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from a cheese sandwich, but I, my dear fellow coders, do not know much about coding. But what makes me a good app developer? Creativity. This one word is so powerful, it contains centuries of stories, of messages of inspiration, that my 2020 Macbook just doesn’t get (Please don’t tell me in the contacts that there are no 2020 macbooks, I know your life sucks, just don’t take it out on me, ok? ). Developing tech can only get you so far, redefining tech by who it can accommodate for, and making their lives easier, that is a goldmine. And it isn’t even rocket science.I am a coder, an artist and a writer. I was an artist way before I started coding. (Also I am a teenager )
Many times, art and coding are seen as opposite things (am I right?). It’s like if you’re a good coder, you just can’t be a good artist and viceversa.



 giga2095771915:

However, are there really enough resources out here that will help coders… not code but express themselves more in a better way?


Oh man, I struggle with expressing  myself SO DARN MUCH. But one resource that I found really useful, are these forums. These are some things that I love being able to do in here:


Helping others with their coding problems (learning to explain the concepts in my head and see things from someone else’s perspective)


Asking for help with my own coding problems (learning to ask good questions)


Simply expressing how I feel about coding, things that coding has taught me


These forums truly have helped me to translate my coding knowledge and ideas into words, which is something I value a lot.



 giga2095771915:

How does a person who thinks like a computer, tells it what to do, foster enough creativity?


In my personal experience, doing other non-coding related activities can help a lot. (Like I said, I draw and write). Also trying to work completely by myself on personal projects has helped me a lot, since I have to “force” myself to think about every aspect of the project, whether it’s design, functionality, accesibility…(notice I said force between quotes, since I actually enjoy thinking about the whole process).
So yeah, those were my personal thoughts on some of your points Thank you! I found these insights really helpful, and I hope others are able to benefit from them as well!

Have you read this essay, Hackers and Painters 15 by Paul Graham (co-founder of Y Combinator)? It’s pretty great I truly love reading, so thanks for the article, will definitely check it out I read over it too, seems pretty great! Will check it out as well!I just read it and I loved it! It made so much sense to me and made me feel less discouraged about the way I code. See I’m a digital artist too, and most of the time I will jump headfirst into a project, drawing whatever I want to with no planning. This has coincidentally influenced the way I code, as I prefer to just start typing and “beat my code into working”. I constantly hear “write it on paper”, “plan it out to the littlest detail”, but you know, that never worked for me, and I always felt discouraged because of that.That’s great! Really hope you find furthur sucess with your coding journey! Loved “I just read it and I loved it”I finished reading it. It was really good, and it opened up my mind to the concept of sketching being applied to coding and programming.
I usually plan in amazing detail every single project before I write a single line of code. I like to feel prepared, and not feel like I’m just spitting out code and hoping for the best.
Art-wise, I used to draw only finished illustrations. I never sketched. Facing a blank paper without knowing what I was going to do deeply scared me. But about a year ago, I got a sketchbook and started sketching: drawing whatever was in my mind, practicing, studying pictures, and most importantly, loosing my fear of messing up. My drawing skills just went to another level.
It’s funny how I never thought of that in terms of coding. Code sketching. I’m going to try it out, I feel like it will be a great way to loosen up and learn a bunch of new stuff 


 giga2095771915:

My thoughts on this would be to compare the lessons on using code to your lessons using a tool. It is easy to learn how to use hammers, saws, and nails, but after learning that, it takes commitment and creativity to do fine woodwork.




 lilybird:

Have you read this essay


That was indeed amazing, I can relate to SO many of those points. Especially about fine planning your code/art, I have tried to do this, but it never comes out as well as if I just start typing/drawing.I love this discussion so much! I was an art teacher before I joined Codecademy’s curriculum team and consider myself to be a creative technologist. Art and technology have so many opportunities for intersection, both in the way you can approach coding as a creative practice or literally bring works of art to life through writing programs.
If you’re interested in learning more about creative opportunities in tech, I definitely recommend checking out the field of creative coding. There are dozens are artist programmers/creative technologists out there building beautiful things. A few favorites: Zach Lieberman, Sam Lavigne, Lauren McCarthy, Sarah Rothberg. p5.js is a great JavaScript library built for artists and teachers to learn how to code, but also express themselves visually. Dan Shiffman (my grad school teacher!) has a quality YT channel called the Coding Train with tons of free and live coding videos and projects. They’re sure to inspire something.
I actually do a one day session on creative coding for a class at the School for Visual Arts. Here’s the GitHub repo with my presentation and some resources, including a couple p5.js examples.
Best of luck with your creative endeavors - can’t wait to see what y’all build.


 giga2095771915:

Emotions, my dear coders, are not something computers have.


I would argue that depends on how you define “emotions”. If we talk about emotions as a response to sensory inputs, a state of mind, then how different is it when:

my adrenaline spikes
my heart rate increases
my blood pressure raises
my muscles increase the breakdown of glucose
etc

because I have to rush to catch a train from when my computer is:

signaling the PSU for a higher voltage
allocating more RAM addresses
prioritizing processes in the CPU stack
pre-allocating space in my hard drive
etc

because I’m downloading the latest Ubuntu distro while playing PUBG online with friends and talking to them on Discord? Would you say my computer is getting “pumped up” or “excited” due to the higher energy consumption, greater focus on a primary task and larger input of signals?
This is just a thought experiment, but I like thinking about how our definitions of worldly things apply to our own creations. You know how someone might look at an old table and say it has “character”. We constantly project our experiences to things around us. In this regard, I think coding is very much the same. The care and dedication to clean, concise code, the clever use of algorithms and optimizations, the teamwork involved with UI designers, product managers, and other engineers… I like to think a great deal of creativity and passion goes into software products just as much as a carpenter puts into a new crib or a surgeon puts inside an OR.I really like your way of thinking. See, this is why I love the comment section, get the way different people interpret different things you say. Loved it!"
362,"How Anthropology, Soccer, and Women Matter to Coding (If you like any of these, this is for you!)",Random,0,115,"So, when I’m on a flow, writing, it’s awesome, let me tell you. By the way @aorchowski, really applaud the way you helped garner yourself a lot of readers, and are making an effort to merge healthcare into the world of coding + quick shout out to @yizuhi, for commenting on my post, really gave me a lot of insight! You both have inspired me, so I want to do something similar with this post. Also, if you haven’t checked out my last post, it’s in Careers, Journey’s and Stories, it’s called “Coding Isn’t Hard, it’s like rocket science!” I also have another post published under “Suggestions, Feature, and Course Requests” called “There’s a New Idea For Teens? No way!” So, if you want to check those out, there they are! However, my topic today is going to be about those who feel underrepresented in the community, and how we can apply the outside-world in coding. For example, how are women perceived in the coding industry? Let me answer that first, because as I was typing the question, a quick thought occurred to me. Don’t women have the same capability of typing in the same numbers and letters? Like they both have fingers, right? Male dominance has always been a pillar of some sorts in our society, in that a lot of phenomenons that were introduced early in civilization were handled by men, when women held no role in science at all. Well, maybe one or 2 scientists helped out with breaking this rule (See: Marie Curie), there were not enough trailblazers to stand in the way of demolishing this belief in the 21st century. I think we should change that. Not many people realize what a lack of women in the coding industry means. It means that this idea  of a society has not changed for centuries, so, what will? No seriously, if woman after woman couldn’t get the job done for years… then what can we do?
This is where I’m going to propose a strategy: Read, with a capital R. One of the first books I ever encountered that gave me the insight into what actually went on behind the fields of science and math was Primates, which is a book on 3 women, Jane Goodall, Birute Galdikas, and Dian Fossey. When reading this book, I found that a lot of anthropology had been linked to how we define our advancements in technology. Early in the years, man or civilization had always been defined by the use of tools, which is what led to the discovery that we share over 90% of our DNA with chimps. But we’re going to take that phrase away, and input it with a new hypothesis I came up with: Man is the ability to create tool (Yes, I know I’ve been going on about how there’s a lack of women in the industry and all, but I’m trying to get into the whole spirit of things, so don’t @ me about that!  ). However, back to the main idea, we have to be able to create and spread awareness of this issue. Create awareness and cultivate enough information to prove employers wrong. I know a lot of us may not have experience with, I don’t know, setting up a benefit (although that would be great), or something else professionally done, but why can’t we assume leadership in the role of women in tech by being empowered together? So she wants to feel confident, so she’ll add a bit of that eyeshadow, maybe she’ll wear a dress because she likes the coulour,(I’m Canadian, so I’m going to spell it with a U) but that does not, make her brain any less than a man’s. In fact, those qualities just make her bold, daring. It’s like deciphering someone’s character from how they play sports. The person who always follows the rules to a T, you know they’re a stickler for rules and will never compromise safety to win a game. This is the exact same! I hope you learned about how women are perceived in the role of coding, and how we should expand our platforms to make our voices be heard. “She wrote some code just on the paper itself, and she’s really somebody we point to in our heritage as our founder of computer science” - Megan Smith on Ada Lovelace."
363,Data Science Path: AI Minimax Algorithm (Module)? Is this a related content to Data Science?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,0,78,"Hi Codecademy,
I want to send this particular topic of conversation to the Codecademy Data Science Content Creator, but I still welcome other Codecademy moderators and learners in this conversation.
I am almost finished with my Data Science path. I am at the AI Minimax Algorithm module 1.
To be perfectly honest and blunt, I am not so sure why this particular module is being taught in the Data Science Course.
From finishing the Linear Regression Module, KNN Module, Random Forest Module, and Classification: Naive-Bayes module, and now jumping straight into this AI Minimax Algorithm module, I feel a disconnect in my learning. As a result, I have no idea what’s the main idea of this particular module.
Don’t get me wrong, I know how to play tic-toe, but what is the main reason this module is included in the Data Science curriculum?
Also, as I am completely new to the Machine Learning field, it has not been easy to understand the narratives you made in each module of Machine Learning (let’s just say the narratives made in these modules are not entirely beginner’s friendly, there is definitely a lot of room for improvement there) but I still do get what you are trying to convey. Except for this AI Minimax module.
So, can someone from the Codecademy reach out to me and answer my question? Because I don’t wanna put my time and energy into something that is not related to my main purpose of taking the data science curriculum in the first place.
I don’t mean to brag but I have been very disciplined with my learning here (check my profile for proof) and I just thought Codecademy should know if someone like me thinks this way, there must be others from the past (and potentially from the future) think of the same thing too.

364,Sustainability and Computer Science,Random,0,88,"Here’s a quick story for those of you who like to sit by the fire, with a cup of hot cocoa (OK, so this may be the third mention of food, but it’s only because it’s delicious, k?), or even relax by a sunny bay and forget about life, this one’s for you:
I was browsing Youtube and found a lot of DIY videos on my feed, which is where I got my idea for this post. Sustainability in coding. How does it work? I propose this: Sustainability refers to the minimization of resources, and using finite resources at an amount at which they can sustain themselves. How does coding apply to this rule? Coding can be more sustainable by allowing certain devices to control more of what they do, since more technology and electronics are required to meet more of our needs. So, the development of a feature in a technology that can do more would be an example of sustainability. While how many electronics and physically-held technologies are used may come down to the engineering of computers, the language of these computers that enables them to do what they can is what makes them sustainable. There are also many other factors that come into play, such as ergonomics,and fixed shelf- lives that are controlled by the designers of technologies, which is why changing code to be sustainable would be better, since you can’t exactly change the amount of  time code is able to exist. Well, those are my thoughts on combining the principals and meaning of sustainability in the environment to coding. Signing off, you know who made this post, do I really have to sign off?

365,Dealing with Frustration while Learning to Code,Random,14,532,"Hi everyone! There is this little something that has being going around my head lately, and I wanted to share it with you guys.
I’ve seen many people experience a lot of frustration while learning (anything in general), and sometimes that frustration leads them to give up. And I speak also for myself, I have, many times, experienced frustration while trying to learn new coding concepts. I still do, in fact. But now I know how to deal with it. Here are 4 tips I want to share with you on how to overcome frustration while learning to code (or anything else, really).
1. Make analogies with real life
Learning new coding concepts can be hard, especially if it’s your first time. (Or if you’re just learning concepts but never really learn how to apply them). That’s why it can be really helpful to compare what you’re learning to something else you already know. For example, the very concept of learning to code can be compared to learning a language. Programming languages also have their own syntax rules and other characteristics that make them unique. Of course, it can be a little bit tricky trying to come up with analogies yourself for things you’re still trying to understand, so in this case I’d really recommend asking someone who knows more about the topic.
2. Take a break.
A point comes in where you’re just not learning anymore, you’re not making progress. Time isn’t really productive anymore; you’re blocked. First of all, chill, it’s normal. Then take a break! Have some fresh air, maybe a snack…do something you like and stop thinking about the problem you’re facing. Then you can come back to your problem with a fresh pair of eyes and find a new perspective! Speaking of which…
3. Look for a new perspective
Sometimes, no matter how much effort we put into it, we still can’t manage to fully understand some concepts. In these cases, another pair of eyes comes really useful. Ask for help! Whatever question you have, it’s extremely likely that someone else also had it and figured out the answer. So ask someone for help, or look for articles on the Internet that can help you.
4. It’s ok to feel dumb
Last but definitely not least. This is the one I struggle with the most. I feel dumb because I don’t know certain things, I can’t explain them or I just CANT UNDERSTAND THEM!! Take a deep breath. That’s right, you can’t do some stuff right now, but that’s ok because you’re here to learn. So please, stop being negative to yourself. You’re never gonna get anywhere if you don’t think you can.
And don’t forget that feeling frustrated is normal! We all get frustrated many times while learning to code. But if you fight through it, you’ll come out with new, solid knowledge.
If you bothered to read until here, THANK YOU so much. Feel free to leave your personal opinion on this topic or ask for help below Very inspiring… especially the 4 the point "" it’s ok to feel dumb"".I have been really tired from coding from a few days so frustrated …
P.s. thanks for the like @toastedpitabreadSo glad it inspired you 
Yeah we’re all here to learn, and it takes time so don’t worry Thank you for posting this. Especially point 4.
Speaking from experience, I know that I would get really frustrated with myself if I didn’t understand something that’s new to me. Which is why points 1 & 4 above work in conjunction.
I think we need to remember to not beat ourselves up and to be kind to ourselves when learning new concepts or technologies. We’re not “dumb.”   We can’t expect to immediately understand complex stuff. I mean, we don’t learn by osmosis!  We have to remember to talk to ourselves the way we would talk to someone else if we were teaching them to code–with a combination of patience and empathy.
And then there’s that moment when you finally understand something…you look around for someone to high five. Or perhaps that’s just me. haha.Totally agree with you. (Also so glad you liked my topic ).

Though I have MUCH to learn in the areas I am working in, not much makes me smile as much as being able to offer assistance to a fellow programmer and in the end seeing their program work flawlessly, or a website display pixel perfect.
Quite often if a see a topic, I don’t know the answer too, I love to experiment myself and try to solve it, or read one of the more advanced programmers answers to see what I can learn.
I have been interested in computers and science for quite a while now, though I didn’t really start programming until earlier this year. I have seen the growing use of computers, every day they seem to be used in yet another aspect of our lives. From advanced jobs like calculating the orbit trajectories of asteroids and comets, to the simple tasks like an electric toothbrush staying activated for a full minute.
And with the tech world growing so rapidly, I believe at least basic programming skills are something everyone should know.
I have been interested in web development for a while now, and Python is a favorite when I want to fiddle with something. Though the more I work with computers, the more I find myself becoming interested in the lower level languages and I am working my way gradually towards them.
I have devoted most of my time so far to:

Python
C/C++
Front end web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My current goal with my coding adventure, is to be able to make my own operating systems from scratch. I have begun to learn the enormousness of this task, but it is something I hope to someday achieve.

-ShaylinHello! I’m interested in a few languages-Python, C#, Ruby and HTML/CSS-although I do know a few others. I mainly code for fun, but I’ve made a few tiny programs to help in my day-to-day life.
Learning to code isn’t just about learning the languages-it is about learning to think-if not similar to a computer-but logically. There is also a great deal of problem solving that you need to learn how to do/think about-that is one thing I really like about coding!
I joined CC in January this year, and became a SU in April. Being a SU-for me-is about helping other people, and making sure they understand everything they want to before they move on. There’s been many a question which I know I’ve struggled with, and it makes me happy to see when a question has been solved! There is a bit of keeping the community tidy-but not much since you all do a great job of organising where to post topics, etc!Who are you?
I’m an anthropomorphic bread that decided to go back to school for CS because of the pandemic.
What languages are you interested in?
Haskell is something that I’m looking into (at the moment).  But there aren’t any languages that inherently disinterest me. I’m agnostic in this sense. Java was my first language but I consider Python to be my native one (of the programming ones…). I learned javascript back when it wasn’t cool, but I’ll be the first to admit that it’s a real powerhouse now… and that it can be … gasp enjoyable 
Any coding project goals in mind?
Anything to do with improving the concept of remote education.
Also anything to do with empowering citizens to easily access the most local political information.
What does learning to code mean for you?
It’s a technical means for expressing what I believe in.
When did you join Codecademy?
May 2020, became a superuser in July.
What does being a SuperUser in this community mean to you?
I’m just glad to be of any use to anyone who needs it. I’ve been helped along the way many times over the years, and I like to do the same. Not for the cookies, but for the love of learning.

Hi, I’m Lisa. I joined Codecademy waaaaay back in the early days of 2012. A friend suggested it to me and I checked it out while I was bored at work. I first started with HTML & CSS and really liked the UI, so, I sort of stayed with it off and on. I came back to it a few years ago when I was interested in learning more about SQL & Python for data analysis. Now my interest has piqued to data science & predictive analytics and so I’m plugging my way through the DS path. I’m also interested in learning R and making maps. Data.Is.Everywhere. I’ve always been interested in trying to understand and interpret the world around me & to seek out improvements where needed. I get geeked whenever the Census releases new ACS data or the NYT has a zip code-based map of the US detailing how people have voted.
Current projects include: getting the NYC Council to clean up/fix it’s survey questions/data for Participatory Budgeting for easier analysis and trying to figure out how to use GeoPandas to make maps and how to build more web scrapers (I’ve done it a couple times and want to improve). I also have many, many other projects in mind. Help! 
I became a SU earlier this year and have enjoyed being able to help out other learners. I have had many mentors who have helped me along my coding journey and I truly believe in paying it forward. I know what it’s like to get frustrated when learning new  new coding/programming concepts and I also know what it’s like to have that “Ah Ha!!” moment when it all clicks. There are a lot of super smart people here in this community and I’m grateful to learn from them and happy to be here and help out other learners where I can.¡Hola a todos! My name is Federico (I go by Fede) and I was born and raised in southern Spain. About ten years ago I moved to the US, first to the Midwest and now the East Coast. People have characterized me as energetic, talkative and overall a happy person 
I started coding in high school and quickly became hooked to technology in general. I went to university to study engineering and kept working on projects that allowed me to expand on my coding journey. I think what made me so interested in coding was the realization that computers are everywhere in our daily lives (how we get news, navigate to places, shop for things online, how power is delivered to our homes, logistics, finance, banking, education, medicine, etc) and I’ve always been curious to know how things work and how to manipulate them to make them do what I want them to.
Although my Codecademy account dates back to 2012, I only became a regular user last year. I discovered that beyond the lessons there was this awesome community and I wanted to be part of it. I like the saying “when one teaches, two learn”. I think helping people in the community helps me in return, big time. I was incredibly lucky  to be spotted by other community leaders and so I became a SuperUser. I’m always happy to help or contribute any way I can, so feel free to send DMs my way if you need me!Hi all!
I’m @el_cocodrilo, a Super User from the U.S.  I’m passionate about affordable  and accessible education for everyone, and I just so happen to love to code as well.  If you are interested, here are a few things about me and the road that led me here:
My Codecademy Journey
I joined Codecademy back 2016 out of curiosity, but didn’t begin taking the courses seriously until around 2018 and only began participating regularly on the forums as of April this year.  Prior to Codecademy I had almost no exposure to code, outside of hacking the HTML in MySpace themes back in the day.
Like many learners here, I struggled to find the motivation and spare time to learn to program when I first started out.  I found it incredibly frustrating that if a few days passed between study sessions I would forget what I had just learned and have to spend time relearning material in my limited free time.
For me, the turning point was deciding to try out Python rather than continue with HTML and CSS.  I was doing a lot of data analysis and number crunching for my job in Excel, and Python immediately resonated with me as a powerful tool for processing that data faster.  Having goals in mind (making my work faster and easier) and seeing a tangible and immediate “real world” benefit made studying before and after work and on the weekends much easier.
For those of you who are struggling, I guarantee that if you set a goal and work toward it a little each day, you will get there.  Like many things in life, persistence and consistent practice are the most important factors in learning to program.
Languages
Although Python is my go-to language, I’ve also come to really enjoy both Swift and Julia and I’ve acquired an appreciation for SQL along the way.   I also know HTML and CSS, as well as some C++, and recently I’ve been learning JavaScript and PHP to round out my web dev skills.  If you get stuck or have any questions with any of the above, feel free to reach out and I’ll do my best to help.
Projects
Since competing in the Python Discord Summer Code Jam 3 (where we used Django to build websites), I’ve been focusing mainly on web projects to improve my front end skills.  My goal is to be fluent enough in JavaScript that I feel comfortable building dynamic websites by the end of September .
Other than that, I primarily focus on data analysis, data visualization, and data science projects using Python.  I also built an Android app this summer using Python’s Kivy framework that will be ready for release on Google Play soon.
Free Advice
If I could start learning to code from scratch, I would do a few things differently.  Here are my suggestions:


Set up a local coding environment and start coding on your own computer as soon as possible.  You can always copy and paste your answers into the Codecademy lessons, or complete them on Codecademy’s platform and then paste them onto your own device to keep practicing.


Start learning and using Git/Github right away.  Once you get used to saving your work with Git and uploading it to Github, you will not only have a valuable (and necessary) skill for this industry, you will have visible proof of all your work for potential employers.  Also, if something happens to your computer, your code is backed up online for free.


Once you know some of the basics, look to official documentation and source code when you have questions.  The sooner you get comfortable reading docs, the better.  It is a skill that you can develop and improve, believe it or not.  Also, when you’re using open source libraries and frameworks, sometimes the answer you’re looking for won’t be officially documented.  Looking at the source code will not only help you solve problems, reading the code of more experienced programmers can help you improve your own code.


Work on projects that interest you.  It doesn’t matter if you finish them.  Just going through the process of coming up with your own project, planning it out, and trying to do it are crucial for getting past those learning plateaus.



Good luck and happy coding!Hello Everyone!
I’m Jenny from Canada.  I took my first course with Codecademy in 2017 learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  I had joined as a moderator on  Slack, moved to Mobilize and now a SuperUser on the forums.  Currently, I’m working through Python on the Data Science path.
I enjoy helping others learn to code and recognize the importance of having a community to ask questions no matter how silly they may seem.  It’s always inspiring to hear all the learner stories.
Looking forward to connecting.Hi everyone, I’m Victoria from Canada!
I joined Codecademy in April 2020, found the forums in July, and became an SU in September. I’ve always been interested in computers and technology and regained an interest in programming earlier this year. Currently, I mainly code for fun and I believe it’s a good skill to learn as it improves your problem-solving and as technology becomes more integrated with our daily lives.
I’m interested in a couple of languages; I’ve taken the Learn Python 3 course here on CC, some Java courses online, and I’ll be tackling those needed for web development next (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
For me, being an SU is an opportunity to learn—learning from more experienced programmers and when helping others. Though I still have a long way to go on my programming journey, it’s great to be able to help others struggling with the same things I once struggled with. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
Happy coding!"
367,7 Things to Consider Before Attending a Coding Bootcamp ,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,251,"I know a lot of people are thinking about transitioning jobs post-pandemic, or have been forced to look for new employment as a result of it. That’s why I thought it would be useful to share this with the community!
Link to the full post 8
Main takeaways:

Make sure you really enjoy coding. Like really really enjoy it. Try coding for 100+ hours and see how you feel about it.
Check jobs in your area (or where you would like to work) and make sure the typical requirements align with the sort of bootcamp you are going into.
Keep in mind that while Bootcamps like to boast about alumni landing jobs at big tech companies, for most graduate it will be less so. It will still be competitive and hard work. There aren’t magical shortcuts.

And while we are on the topic, let’s not forget cheaper online alternatives! For what I’ve heard from people attending coding bootcamps, what they enjoyed the most was:

Structured learning (being told what to learn)

Online alternatives: Places like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, etc usually offer curriculums and syllabus with all the material.


Being pushed to learn (a lot of people have discipline problems when learning on their own)

Online Alternative: getting involved with other students and online communities can help you stay motivated and accountable! A good study group can push you to reach your goals.


Networking with alumni and industry recruiters

Online alternative: if you find a company you would like to work for, find out if they host events online open to the public, find current devs in that company on social media like Twitter and politely ask for advice, use tools like LinkedIn to connect to others and build relationships.



I’d love to hear how online learners here are moving through their learning journey, and if they have found success landing jobs or connecting with industry! And of course, people that have experience with bootcamps!Really informative, nice!"
368,"Purpose, Meaning, Drive","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,271,"Hi, I’m from Germany and I have completed my B.Sc. in Media Informatics at the start of the year.
I am struggling with finding deeper “purpose” and meaning in what I do and I come here to ask for advice.
My entire life I have been kind of a computer nerd and in school I realized my talent for coding. I then went on to pursue an apprenticeship as IT businessman at a big retail company but I didn’t find fulfillment there. It was mostly dealing with systems administration, particularly in SAP, and didn’t envolve coding at all.
I decided I need to dig deeper and started to study Media Informatics. I believed this to be a good choice since I would be able to combine coding with creative design. But then again, I was always very bad at arts or tinkering, this creative stuff. Only thing I excelled in was creative writing, and well, coding. I enjoy beautiful design, though.
I decided to study web development in my free time more deeply because it seemed like the most practical approach. I got particularly interested in Blockchain, I kinda fell for the hype of 2017 and lost a lot of money but I believed in the technology and implications of it. So I decided to use my interest and talent and I landed a job as working Student as a Blockchain Engineer.
When I was there I quickly realized how low my technical knowledge actually was. My mates were far more proficient than me. I ended up specializing mostly in Frontend stuff, because the backend and blockchain stuff was over my head.
Because of this experience, I decided to focus more on the Frontend side and after my graduation, I landed a job as a Junior Frontend Engineer for an E-Commerce Platform Provider. This job made me feel more comfortable, because it was more appropriate for my skill level. But I kinda missed the deeper purpose that I felt when working on the Blockchain stuff.
Now the company is basically bankrupt thanks to COVID-19. I therefore have to find a new job just a couple months after beginning.
Now I am having kind of an existential crisis. I don’t know which path to go. I have been working myself into more backend and cloud stuff but just foundational knowledge without much practice. I am solid in Frontend Development, but something inside me screams that this isn’t what I want to do forever. I like the work itself, designing and implementing user interfaces and features. That’s not the problem. But it feels dull at times and pointless.
Like, I am creating websites and apps, but it doesn’t really feel like I’m actually achieving something profound. It’s just digital pixels appearing on the user’s screen. There is no deeper meaning, nothing groundbreaking, it’s just a job.
I have been thinking of moving to other fields like Machine Learning. But this would mean all my built-up knowledge on web development has been for waste. And I don’t want to be hopping from one thing to the next until I’m bored again.
So to summarize, I like the work itself, the coding, the creation of cool User Experience and new Features. I also like digging into new technology and learning. But I am missing an inner drive, a deeper meaning, a clear goal what I want to achieve. I don’t want to waste my life.
Do you have any thoughts, inspiration, ideas about this? Have you ever experienced the same thing?
Thanks in Advance.I’m turning 40 this year and I’ve come to the conclusion that we feel this way because society has instilled in us the need for a deep purpose, finding what fulfills you in order to achieve complete happiness. I’ve been where you are, I’ve spent countless days wondering, researching, and coming up with nothing.
We trouble ourselves too much with trying to find that deeper meaning without which we can’t achieve fulfillment. The same can be said about personal relationships, movies and books have brainwashed us to believe that there is that special person out there that is perfect for us and when we find them we will live happily ever after.
News flash, that’s not how relationships work. That’s not how life works. No relationship is perfect, just like no 1 single thing in life will fulfill you. Everything requires work, there will be good days and there will be bad days. What fulfills you today may not fulfill you in 3 years.
This does not mean you have to give up or settle, for anything. Compromise, yes. Settle, no.
Things change. People change. It’s inevitable, it’s part of life.
The person you love today will change, it is up to you to change and adapt or move on.
The job that fulfills you today will change, it is up to you to change and adapt or move on.
Personal example: I’m from Colombia and I was never satisfied there. As I was growing up The American Dream was instilled in me, it was the ultimate goal, the land of opportunities. That translated to “move to the USA and your life will be perfect”. I’ve been here for 11 years and… the world changed, life changed. While I know I’m better off here than back home and I have had great opportunities because I’ve been here, at the moment this is not my utopia. I am not fulfilled. This is not enough for me. Unfortunately, my options are limited so I make the best out of my situation. At the moment, it involves learning how to play the bass and being active in this community, helping people who are struggling with things I’ve struggled with in my career.
No, I’m not miserable. I have everything I need and other things that I really don’t need. I don’t feel fulfilled, but after starting something new it goes away, for a bit.
Now, back to you.


What you’ve learned and done so far is not a waste of time. You have a skill you didn’t have before. It helps you build critical thinking skills that allow you to learn new things faster.


Ask yourself: If money was not an issue, what would you do? The answer to this question is often tied to the existential crisis you mentioned. After doing lots of research myself I’ve found that people who claim to have achieved what you’re looking for started doing something they loved because… they loved it. Money was not the driver, only satisfaction in doing something they liked. If you do something because you’re passionate about it, the money eventually follows. I don’t mean I’m filthy rich money, I mean money to cover your expenses and enjoy your life.


Once you have an answer (or answers), then ask yourself how can you apply the knowledge that you have towards it? This essentially boils down to:

finding a job in an industry tied to your answer
branching out on your own

If you’re interested in branching out on your own (freelancing), there’s a Q&A on it next week you can sign up for.
https://www.codecademy.com/events/codecademy-and-you-freelancing-pablo-chois  2
The last thing to consider is that your job doesn’t define you, it only provides the income you need to live your life. Yes, jobs are boring and tedious but again, that’s life. If you don’t love your job, get a different one. Doing what? There’s no magic formula to answer it, most of the time you just have to try something new. There’s a very good chance there is a job out there that won’t bore you, it might not even be related to software development. The answer(s) to question #2 will help in this regard.I’m so glad that you’re asking these deep questions about how you want to find fulfillment through work.
Generally, I think about three big picture areas for work satisfaction:
1.) The role. How intrinsically meaningful do I find the day-to-day work of my role?
2.) The company or organization. Do I align with and derive value from the overall mission of the company? Is it in a field or industry that I want to learn more about?
3.) The people. How good is my relationship with my manager and my peers?
For me, I know that I need 2 out of these 3 things to be happy and motivated (although if any of them is super messed up it can make other positives disappear). If I really like the work that the company is doing, it might be okay for awhile that my own role isn’t exactly what I would want (or vice versa). For you, would being a junior front-end developer at a company that was in a field that you’re more interested in than e-commerce be more fulfilling?
Generally, building a track record of success in one field will help you pivot into other related fields. The programming knowledge you learned for web development will help you more than you realize if you pivot to machine learning, for example.
My advice would be to try to look for a job with whatever skillsets you have that you are most confident with today (which sounds like it is front end development). From there, you can try to progress internally, and take on more backend or data-heavy work, or explore other fields in tech that you are interested in that you think you might be more passionate about.First of all, love the title. And if your looking for a little bit of creativity, I wrote an article on art and freedom in coding and design called "" Coding isn’t hard, it’s like rocket science!"". I think it can give you the inspiration you need, but here’s the most important thing: Never loose hope. If you do, then you’ll lack the complete motivation and not be able to put yourself in a better situation. Reading what you’ve been through, I would suggest, freelancing, or starting even a movement to connect with people who may be in the same situation as you. That’s my advice, and don’t worry, the day will always follow the night, and as cheesy as that sounds (mmm… cheese!) I hope you have the inspiration you need!"

370,The Social Dilemma (2020),Random,4,193,"Hi everyone,
Watched this movie already?



IMDb 3



The Social Dilemma (2020) - IMDb 3
Directed by Jeff Orlowski.  With Skyler Gisondo, Kara Hayward, Vincent Kartheiser, Tristan Harris. Explores the dangerous human impact of social networking, with tech experts sounding the alarm on their own creations.





For those who are more advanced to what technology is concerned… is the panorama as bad as depicted in this movie? Are we sort of reaching social apocalypse because of the way in which social media is hurting “the fabric of society”? I am truly curious about what experienced tech people think about this. Can we become part of the solution by learning to develop applications that, above everything else, stand out as ethical… or is this idea plainly utopic?
Cheers!Ask Jack or Zuck. 
j/k
I hadn’t heard about this until I saw a trailer online. I’m curious about it & might watch it.
I will say that hello, data is everywhere and of course the companies are going to collect it to learn more about users (it’s naive to think that they won’t/don’t). Does it make it right? (See the Cambridge Analytics -FB data breach for reference).
Everything is monetized. I guess the question is…can a company be profitable AND ethical?
All those cookies agreements that you click “OK” to when you visit a site…what happens with that?
You have Siri enabled on your phone or have an Alexa? Gee, why are there ads targeted on your social media account specifically for you?
It’s creepy.Well, I bet that’s the whole point of the whole question.
I mean, yeah, data is everywhere, and that’s something that we all already know, but — what I truly mean is —, is it as terrible as depicted in the movie? Because the film speaks about it in terms of social extinction, social apocalypse, and so on. It’s freakin’ scary, to say the least.
And now, beyond that, how do we get rid of social media? How, for example, can a small business — here’s my marketer side speaking — promote itself nowadays if not using social media and similar channels — such as paid positioning in Google (aka SEM campaigning)?
Anyway, have a look at the movie; I quite liked it 
Cheers!I’m in data analytics & data science…So, I get it. 
Small biz needs social media to promote itself for sure. Does it stink that they have to pay for positioning in Google? (yea, I think so).
I’d have to see the movie to comment more on it—especially the part about Google’s predictive text when searching. One can definitely see how one can get into a bubble of fake news.
Does it mean social extinction or apocalypse? I don’t know. As far as dissemination of news in some ways (most?) I think social media hurts it. It all goes back to Chomsky and The Manufacture of Consent. Eons ago when I was in high school there were 26 corporations that owned all media. Now, it’s like what? 3? 4? That’s a concerning (to say the least) problem just as it was when it was 26. It’s something that ppl need to be aware of and they need to be critical thinkers when it comes to filtering news and information.Well, that’s the whole point of the movie — or one of the main ones at least —; I think you’ll enjoy it very much.
Thanks for sharing! "
371,How many language should you learn?,Learn From Home Club,9,440,"So, let’s open the discussions here. There is so many language out there and even new language is being developed by big name such Google and Facebook like Angular and React. But there must be a limitation on how many you can remember every language like you can understanding with some language you know. Like me, I natively from Indonesia which fluently on English and trying to adding new language such Japan. But Human capacity is had a limited, while many people wanna flexible like what happen right now with this pandemic.
So, How many language barely minimal to be a developer, whether it’s a Game Developer or just Full-stack Web Developer?Hello! Once you learn one language (say Python), the rest become very similar, so you can really learn a lot of languages once you’ve learnt one language, the rest of the languages which are same type (functional, etc) become quite easy to learn. To become a full stack developer, you’d probably (at least) need HTML, CSS, JS-react etc, PHP (for the backend), and SQL (for database querying). A game developer would probably need similar languages, albeit you wouldn’t need JS-you could choose most programming language for that (although some are definitely better than others).I’m trying to open discussion. I want to know about people opinion since there is so much new language and technique to do something. such new framework Flareact where helping to make dynamic site to be static at edge, Gatsby and Netlify to build static site. etc.
But, that answer maybe useful for other people who join this thread to know what they need and the similarity. ThanksThis doesn’t seem to be what you want to hear, but…
There is no physical limitation to what you can learn, you are only limited by your attitude. Plenty of people speak 7 different languages fluently, it all depends on your attitude and what your goals are.
Software-wise, there is also no limitation either. These are languages I know:
C++
Assembly
Ladder
C#
JAVA
Javascript
Typescript
Python
Ruby
SQL
These are frameworks that I know:
Selenium
Angular
Node
Kubernetes
The keyword here is know, which is different than mastered. Knowing something means you can read it and understand it, make changes to it. Mastering something is entirely different, you can master different languages it just takes a lot more time.
I’m not telling you this to brag about what I know, I’m telling you this because I say it on a lof of posts: You never stop learning, you need to be adaptable. A new language or framework is not created to screw with people, it’s created because it serves a specific purpose and it’s useful. As a software developer, you need to be able to adapt to the trends otherwise you’re going to be stuck professionally.
To answer your question directly: How many languages should you learn?
As many as you can.
If you ever feel that you already learned what you need while being in this profession, I’m sorry to say that your career is over. I’ve been in this field for close to 13 years and I constantly feel I don’t know enough. I’m always looking to learn something new, it is what has allowed me to be in the position that I am today. 6 years ago I left a wonderful job because I felt I was stuck, I didn’t have any opportunities to move up. All that changed when I quit that job and was forced to learn something new, 6 years later I hold the position of the person who didn’t know what to offer me in order to keep me as an employee.
Learning a new language will always give you a new opportunity, there is no denying that. How many opportunities you want to go after, is entirely up to you.Disclaimer: highly subjective answer:
I think it’s a bit of a false analogy to compare regular languages to programming languages. As @codeneutrino said, learning one can unlock many others (for example, I can convert my python programs into swift even though I’ve never studied it a single day, I just need to take a quick look at documentation here and there).
In terms of how many languages I’d say it depends on the type of programmer you want to be. I do think at least 1 object-oriented and 1 functional is a good start. Low level stuff like assembly could be good (but that’s again, very dependent on what type of programmer you want to be). Some base proficiency in SQL…
Imo it’s good to have a high proficiency in 1 where you can completely digest and experiments with new concepts. Then contextually be proficient at the ones that are related to the things you want to do. And finally, be adaptable to be able to think in different paradigms (like functional, or if you’re coming from functional – oop).
Here’s Stroustrup talking about this topic
Bjarne Stroustrup: Learn More than One Programming Language
Yeah, I wasn’t trying to compare linguistics with programming, my point was more about your attitude towards learning something. If you truly want to learn something, the only thing stopping you is your attitude.
I learned Assembly and Ladder in college because I needed to pass the course, haven’t used it since (16 years… ■■■■). Everything else I’ve learned because I need to do something at work, I learned what I needed and I moved on. My background is in QA, I haven’t had the need to master something, proficiency is enough.Oh no my comment wasn’t aimed at you @peachesmotorsports! Your reply was spot on. And I think exemplified that context really matters (hence why everyone says, it depends what you want to do).
It was just that the OP expressed an existential question of how feasible it was to learn multiple languages comparing it to real-life languages. I studied 2 very serious years of mandarin a decade ago and I still can’t hold a normal conversation. I slacked through 2 years of java in high school (still aced the AP) and I can still fake my way through it when I need to use it.

372,[N/A] Codecademy environment shows me: TypeError,Bug Reporting,10,135,"Hi.
I’m practicing on Lodash Project 2, and when I’m trying with _pad(), codecademy environment shows me: TypeError: string.padStart is not a function.
However, in my computer it perfectly works, and node.js shows me this:
1 - _.pad() is defined - Passed! 2 - Returns strings longer than provided length un-padded - Passed!         3 - Returns evenly-padded strings - Passed! 4 - Returns oddly-padded strings with extra padding on right side - Passed!
I just copied the method I wrote:
pad(string, number){
        const differene=number-(string.length);
        const paddNumber=differene/2;
        if(differene%2===0){
          const first=string.padStart((string.length)+paddNumber);
          const second=first.padEnd((first.length)+paddNumber);
          return second
        } else{
          const start=Math.floor(paddNumber);
          const end=differene-start;
          const first=string.padStart((string.length)+start);
          const second=first.padEnd((first.length)+end);
          return second
        }
      }
I ran this slightly revised code and got the same result…
  pad (string, number) {
    const difference = number - string.length;
    const padNumber = difference / 2;
    if (difference % 2 === 0) {
      const first = string.padStart(string.length + padNumber);
      const second = first.padEnd(first.length + padNumber);
      return second
   } else {
      const start = Math.floor(padNumber);
      const end = difference - start;
      const first = string.padStart(string.length + start);
      const second = first.padEnd(first.length + end);
      return second
    }
  },

Either this module has a very old version of Node.js behind it, or the function has been disabled. It has been supported since Node.js 8.0.
If you want to pass this step, then try another approach that does not use the .pad___() methods.You can check the version of Node in use from the terminal:

As you can see, it’s v7.10.1Looks like the LE is due for an upgrade. The current version is 13, released in October, 2019.Well, guess I’m gonna keep going XD
Hope they update it.Did you try another approach? Don’t give up.Sure I did. Anything like this?
  pad (str, len) {
    const n = str.length;
    if (len <= n) return str;
    const m = Math.floor((len - n) / 2);
    str = `${' '.repeat(m)}${str}`;
    return `${str}${' '.repeat(len - str.length)}`
  }, 
whaaaaat. That’s way better than mine.
pad(string, number){
        const x=' ';
        const differene=number-(string.length);
        const paddNumber=differene/2;
        if(differene%2===0){
          const word=string.split('');
          for(let i=0; i < paddNumber; i++){
            word.unshift(x);
            word.push(x);
          };
          const wordString=word.join('');
          return wordString
        } else{
          const word=string.split('');
          const start=Math.floor(paddNumber);
          const end=differene-start;
          for(let i=0; i < start; i++){
            word.unshift(x);
          };
          for(let i=0; i < end; i++){
            word.push(x);
          };
          const wordString=word.join('');
          return wordString
        }
      },
If it works, then it can be refactored, I always say, write code that works, then look for simpler ways to make it do the same thing. We don’t get there using other people’s code. Keep working and enjoying the fruits of your own labors.What you said about using other people’s code it’s totally true. I’ll keep working!
Thank you!"
373,There’s a New Idea For Teens? No Way! (Pt.1),Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,0,87,"Yes, way actually. Coding and gaming programming has significantly influenced the lives of teens today, and not just through Fortnite. Social media apps, blogs all play a major role in our lives and influence a lot of our beliefs and overall, lifestyles. Coding offers teens to open their minds up to innovation, and relate what they experience in the outside world to the language of computers. For this reason, I believe the innovation and development of technology is a subject that most teens should know. From my personal experience however, I like to work at my own pace, and use my prior knowledge so that I am able to learn at full capacity. I like to experiment and work with others as well, to build collaboration. Being a coder should be more than just “memorizing Syntax” or “the mindset of programming”, according to the Firehose Project, a website dedicated to coding and real-world application of coding. However, not all of the courses on CodeCademy offer this, which is why I would like to use this post to make a difference in the lives of teen coders, and to petition to introduce a course made specifically for teens that combines their knowledge with the outer world, and the world of coding. Part 2 will be here soon, this is just an introduction, as I’d like to see what you think of the idea, fellow coders! Comment below and include any feedback/questions/any concerns you may have at all, my ears are open and fingers are at the computer all day learning, so you’ll get your answer in just the tap of a few letters, soon. Thank you for reading my post and I hope you were able to learn my perspective on coding as a teen, and how this knowledge can be used to better the education of others in the community. I know that CodeCademy recently offered a program tailored to  post- secondary-level students, but there’s no whiff of innovation, collaboration, or any principals being introduced to appeal to high school students. So, volia this here is the result."

Well done @johannesjohnson80844!!
The content is simple and consise, which is something I love to see.
You have good white space and indentation, and have used semantic HTML, which is good for both screen readers and SEO.
Personally I would put the  <nav> anchors inside of the <li> elements, but this is only due to the fact I don’t link the dots acting as part of the link:
<!-- the dots here will be part of the link -->
<ul>
  <a>

<!--However, here they won't -->

It also appears there are a couple typos in your <p> on lines 35 - 38, as you refer to <td> as being used to create rows and the have a opening angle bracket with no element after it.

375,[Week 4] Reflection and Recommendation,30-Day Challenge,2,340,"Comment on this topic with your responses to prompts during your final week of the challenge. Although I broke my streak because I want to understand C++ in depth from other source, my actual skill is really high in fundamentals, but suck in depth.
(I dont have to think anymore when I type functions, data types, and arrays/vectors, multi-file etc.)It was great seeing that Codecademy had a 30-Day Challenge, so I signed up.  It reminded me of similar challenges I’ve completed before (you can read about them here).  I wanted the 30-Day Challenge to help me develop some good daily habits to stick with the 35-week long Data Science Career Path.  I’ll definitely be doing additional rounds of the 30-Day Challenge as I progress through the Data Science course.
I’m on Day 24 of my first round of the 30-Day Challenge.  I won’t achieve a 30-day streak & I’d be surprised if I ever did (I think the longest streak I had was maybe 4 or 5 days?)  I’m happy enough to just keep moving forward in the Data Science course.
The Data Science course is divided into 26 sections and, so far, I’ve completed the first two sections covering SQL basics.  I just started the third section on intermediate SQL.  I’m currently working through the lesson on aggregate functions.
Hopefully, by my second or third round of the 30-Day Challenge, I’ll have a project or two to share.  I also look forward to becoming more involved in the Codecademy forums!"

Plz comment on web development course how this course helps u?Hi and welcome to the forum.
The web dev course helps you learn many of the basic principals of web development and some more advanced ones too.  You start with HTML and CSS which are the basic building blocks of web design.  You then move onto javaScript which allows you to make your site interactive.  You then look at more advanced content and move to building a web server and API integrating with a database.yeah ! in short we can say its a complete package for a web developer"
377,Nurse here,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",13,919,"I am a Registered Nurse and recently decided to expand my knowledge into the IT field. My love for technology started right after high school when I landed an internship in the local hospital’s Information Services department. It is something I had always wanted to do, but I also wanted involvement with patients and healthcare. That was way back in 2001 and I never thought I could work in both fields. That was until I discovered that nurses are recruited into healthcare IT. We even have a Master’s degree called Nursing Informatics.
I wanted to go the informatics route, but the curricula are somewhat lacking. They teach what information we are getting and why it is beneficial, but they do not explain how to get it. So, I have decided to enroll into the CodeCademy and go the Data Science path.
It would be great if I could land a job with a degree in nursing and some coding skills. However, I also think it would be a great tool to have while studying for Nursing Informatics. I would love to hear from anyone else in the healthcare field. Has this helped at all? What are the job prospects?
I believe the Epic Electronic Health Record is built with a programming language called MUMPS(or M) and SQL. Anyone have experience with it?


 aorchowski:

degree in nursing and some coding skills.


So do you want a degree in coding too? I’m sorta confused that is why i""m asking. Codecademy gets you off to a great start, and you can learn a lot, but doesn’t have everything yet.I’m not interested in a degree in coding. Is that available? Maybe I should check out some schools in my area to see if they have anything like that. I meant I would like to see if I can get a job with just my nursing degree. A position such as an informatics nurse or even a developer at a software company that works on Electronic Health Record software. I mentioned Epic and I believe they have the leading EHR in hospital systems.
So, I want to work on coding skills in my free time. I’m not interested in a degree. I would, however, be interested in working on a Master’s in Nursing Informatics in the future, but I want to see if I can get a job in the field before working on it.I’m really kind of open about which direction my career goes in. I’m not dead set on anything specific. I think my preference would be something within a hospital system and I think Nursing Informatics is the best option for that. I’m open to anything though. It would be interesting to see if EHR companies hire healthcare professionals. I think there are some translation problems between what the creators think we need and what the healthcare team actually needs.Well, you can learn the basics here on Codecademy by being a free member, and learn additionally with Pro and Pro intensives.Hi there. I work In IT (infrastructure) at a healthcare company where data science is a crucial component of what we’re trying to do: attempting to prove health outcomes for patients at our client practices. We have plenty of clinical staff who work on projects with the data scientists, and while everybody seems to work well together, I imagine the clinical staff would love having somebody like you, with interest in both fields, involved in those conversations ! We don’t use epic, rather NextGen. I’m not sure how much dev or coding the NextGen analyst performs, due to the fact that NextGen itself  provides this service for us. But if we had somebody who knew coding and also had extensive knowledge of the needs of clinicians in the field, I imagine that person would be valued greatly!
Anyway, the point is that there are definitely opportunities in this area (Philadelphia), and I imagine there will only be more and more as Healthcare changes (hopefully for the better…).
-NickThat sounds like a really amazing job. I don’t think many people outside of healthcare would understand why, so I can see why they would hire them. Everything we do in healthcare is based on evidence. On top of that, healthcare organizations are paid based on patient outcomes. I could see a huge demand for a service like yours because it would create a higher payment rate.
You actually helped me out a little. There is something that had been bugging me for a while. I could never really figure out how the information goes from research to practice. We have a Quality team that gathers data and tells us what the best Evidence-Based Practice(EBP) is. However, I never really figured out where they are sending the data to or where they get the  EBP from. You guys must be the somewhere at the top of the ladder.
BTW I used to live in NJ and would visit my brother in Philly on the weekends. My favorite place for cheesesteaks was Tony Luke’s.This is partly how I am feeling right now. I am a nursing student and the EHR’s for my clinical rotations are, sorry to say, garbage.I can’t believe it has been over a year since I started this program. Last year I got through most of the Data Science program, but life got in the way. There were some disruptions, but I got it back together by around January of this year. I’m officially enrolled in a program for a Masters in Nursing Informatics and decided to come back to Codecademy. I see a lot of good changes around here and I’m excited to be back. I started the Data Science program again from the beginning and it’s coming back very easily. I’m looking forward to the curriculum and maybe one day soon start on some projects or a portfolio with you guys.It’s been about 3 months since you replied but I wasn’t around. What kind of program are you in? I finished up my BSN recently and enrolled in an MSN program this year. I have about 8 years of experience, so feel free to ask any questions.
I don’t miss nursing school at all lol. That was a stressful time in my life and I gained about 50 pounds.Yes, companies hire healthcare professionals to do different things. Our Chief Clinical Officer is a former RN, we don’t have any in our dev team at the moment.
Data Science is a way to go, but it’s very hard to give you proper advise because EHRs use different technologies. You may finish Codecademy’s course but that doesn’t guarantee you’re getting a job because while you’ll know how to analyze data, the EHR or hospital you want to work for might be using something other than Python. I’ve never heard of MUMPS before, then again I’ve only been working in healthcare for 2 years. Analyzing data is a great skill but EHR features are built more on how much revenue they can produce rather than how useful they can be. Data Science is not easy, it can be very useful but only when done properly (I haven’t seen that).
If you want to be a dev resource in a hospital, I suggest you learn how to write APIs. We use Typescript, Express and Node for that, but we also work with the FHIR standard. Regardless of the EHR you’re working with, FHIR defines the standards on how the data needs to be organized so it can be shared with different systems. You’ll also need database knowledge so take courses on SQL and noSQL (Mongo, MUMPS, etc.). AS a dev resource in healthcare, you’ll be more valuable with this knowledge as it’ll be needed regardless of the UI interface.
I feel like our profiles need an option for a signature, this would be mine: You need to be flexible. Just because you learned 1 language doesn’t that everything can be done in said language, if you only learn 1 language and don’t keep your mind open to new things you’re limiting your options for a job.Thanks for the advice. It’s great to hear from anyone with some insight into healthcare. Although true that you only have 2 years experience, but believe me, you just answered a lot of questions that I haven’t been able to find anywhere else.
I have about a year and a half to finish my informatics program. I had already studied for and passed an exam for the COMPTIA IT Fundamentals. It’s basically a useless cert, but I wanted something on my resume to show that I’m committed to this. Since last year and up until starting grad school, I’ve been thinking how to get into this field. My thoughts were that I’ll study Python and SQL, then build a portfolio full of little projects that I can show off. Maybe even make a website that I can link to my resume and make it interactive to try and impress future employers.
I have been considering what you said about APIs and healthcare specific technologies and I believe you’re right. I don’t think Python/SQL will land me a job so I think it’s something I’ll just show off on a portfolio and tack onto my resume. I was thinking that by the end of my program, I’ll start looking at specific companies or healthcare systems, and browse through their job posts. Hopefully I’ll find something I like, maybe a data analyst, and see what skills they’re looking for. I’ll start learning those skills, maybe take a few classes after graduation, and hopefully bring something to the table if I’m given an interview.COMP TIA is only useful when applying for IT Support jobs, other than that I haven’t seen a need for it. My sister uses EPIC at work, I’ve played with it but I don’t know what was used to build it. It’s very hard to find that kind of information unless you talk to someone who works there. Browsing for jobs will give you an idea, but technologies are always changing.There are many nursing programming IT jobs available now. Numerous schools are utilizing online medical software for school nurses to improve student health records. These school medical software like the one which I utilized in my school named EduHealth, assists with gathering, tracking and managing information of the student’s health in an effective manner. It is a great chance if you get into such a field."
378,Where (if ever acceptable) should I fit these inquiries?,Random,4,117,"Hello everyone,
As I am new to Codecademy and to Codecademy’s discussion forums, I don’t know where to fit some of my inquiries yet (or even if some of these inquiries could be fitted in these forums at all).
Thing is that I am trying to get ahold of this whole computing world after a few years working as a marketer and designing a bunch of websites in Wordpress, but with no thorough knowledge whatsoever to what I was really doing.
I mean, I got my websites running and stuff out of (primarily) intuition, but I haven’t ever quite known what the heck I was truly doing regarding things such as the management of the VPS which I develop my sites in, SSL certificates, mail configuration, etc., which is why I’ve decided that it was about time to start learning some thing very seriously and very thoroughly.
Anyways, thing is that I have a few questions to ask about those aforementioned things (SSL, VPS management, mail configuration and FTP connections), and I don’t want to bother the community by posting my stuff in the wrong place (which is the reason why I’ve come to [Community » Random] to post this first post, because it seems the place where I can do the less harming )

382,The challenge: progress & setbacks,30-Day Challenge,2,149,"Hi everyone, so I’m 26 days in my 30-day challenge within a streak of 30days of doing general Codecademy stuff.
Looking back I think I made solid progress in the web-dev career path, but there are a bunch of things I forgot already; There’s been a lot of going back and forth between earlier lessons, reference sites, documentation, and the lesson I’m currently at. Just to make the knowledge stick.
( Maybe I’m just dumb, hey!)
How’s your progress, wanna share?That’s awesome! 
Keep going!
No, you’re not dumb. I think it’s easy to beat ourselves up when new concepts don’t automatically stick in our brains. Learning this stuff is hard sometimes. It sounds like you’re doing all the right things–going back over previous lessons, etc. Do you take notes when you go through the lessons? I’ve found that taking notes helps me, as well as writing out code examples in Google Colab (I’m on the DS path).
I have learned to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Now, that sounds odd, but, it’s true. I’ve learned that it’s okay to get errors and fail. Why? Because that’s how I learn. And then I know I’ll write the code correctly the next time…
This isn’t a sprint and that’s what so many people think. It’s a marathon and one has to pace themselves. (especially when learning something new). Speeding through the lessons to get that checkmark doesn’t really mean anything if you don’t fully understand the concepts presented to you.
I mean, would you beat yourself up if you couldn’t run 26.2 miles w/o any training? No. Or, would you expect yourself to speak another language fluently w/o ever practicing? No.
So, keep on, keeping on. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else. 
Happy coding!Hi, great effort making it to 26 days.
I sense you were joking but never the less, you aren’t dumb.  If you are then I am and I don’t like the sound of that much!!
I share your experience in forgetting things from earlier in the course and I take comfort in reading comments from people with much more experience that it is normal to have to go back to documentation to check things.
I started on the data path and completed all the SQL elements there.  When I reached the SQL part of the web course I felt I had to do the lessons over as I’d forgotten so much of it.
In an ideal world I think I’d have spent a good month just dong more with HTML and CSS outside of codecademy to get really conversant in it rather than just doing the lessons and projects.  I’m on the cumulative API projects now so almost done on the path.  I think I’ll be going back to basics though once I finish the course.
I have had moments where I feel like I’m just not getting it and feel like stopping and then others where it all makes sense, if even for a moment.  Some real ups and downs!
Keep fighting the good fight."

Coding Vs Programming For Beginners: What Is The Difference? 133
Coding vs programming - is there a difference between these terms that are often used as synonyms? Yes, but what is the difference? Find out more about it.





Programming is more general in regards to the project: balances technical specifications, deals with issues of scaling and efficiency, managing and organizing all the moving parts, etc.
Coding is the more local issue of the language, syntax, debugging (which doesn’t need to take into account the bigger picture, if the syntax is wrong, it’s wrong and there’s one fix).
Often times these terms are conflated and used interchangeably, but “coder” is sometimes pejorative. Outside of tech many people regard it to be the same thing.
There’s the added complication that programmers will often have to code, and coders will have to program. I don’t think there’s a vacuum where the two ideas are completely separate from each other.Coding means writing code for programs or we development. On the other hand, programming looks at the bigger picture when creating apps, while coding is only one aspect of their work."
387,Thank you Codecademy!,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",6,846,"Hi guys,
I’m writing today to thank the team at Codecademy and the many people that donated subscriptions to PRO during this pandemic. I was fortunate enough to get one of these PRO subscriptions and it has opened my life to so many opportunities I can’t thank this community and company enough.
About 3.5 months ago, I began my web development course path when I found out I was laid off from my Sales career in San Francisco. I really enjoyed solving all the course work and eventually, it came to a point where I could converse with my peers about coding. This led to a minor mentorship with a close friend who is a senior web developer. Next, were ideation meetings and through this whole process, I was able to find something I was passionate about; technology, entrepreneurship, and food.
I’m happy to say that today, we started our marketing campaign on Instagram, got users to the website, and successfully transacted orders. This is a great feeling, a small win. I know this path isn’t guaranteed but I know I have more tools in my belt to proceed forward.
Best,
Bryan RheeThat’s amazing Bryan, well done! Keep going at it 
Myself, I am also looking for a small win, after a loads of road ends in the past. I realy love the way CodeCademy explains everything so clearly and I think the pro plan is a great addition.
Good luck with your new passion! If you have any tips on how to reach a goal, I hope you’ll share Hi Lisa,
I’ve been in your position in the past a lot. These past 4 months were not my first attempt at coding. I’ve tried to learn this for the past 10 years, but it always fell off because of a job, social life, or any other excuse I could come up with. Since the pandemic hit, all those things went away and I knew it was time to sit down and figure this out.
My main goal with codecademy was to complete the coursework at minimum of 2% a day. This is where I started to understand what I liked and disliked when it came to learning and coding. I noticed that time would fly by when I couldn’t figure out a problem and I would do endless hours of research, try this and try that, all of a sudden I completed 8% of the coursework. The opposite of that were the grueling hours spent to reach the endless goal of 2%. This initial small goal helped me realize what aspect of coding I liked.
It is especially helpful to have a mentor and close friend to guide me through the process as well. He  had fun exercises for ideation meetings, taught me how to google, and developed a new mindset when it came to looking at problems.
So I guess my tips would be to develop some grit because it will show you what you like and dislike. Also, to network and find someone to help you through the tough times.
If I could help, I’d love to give back to this community and help in some way or form.

Maybe down the road I’ll take you up on that offer!
I love how you set up you daily goals, I am definitively going to look into that, making a similar statement. Sounds like a great way to help you get through the hard parts.
Totally agree on what your suggesting on finding someone to help you! My boyfriend happens to be a fullstack developer, he helps me explain the parts where I feel like I’m lost in the woods a lot! I would recommend any one to find someone either here in codecademy or out in your day to day groups to help!
Thanks again Bryan!Go for the dream follow your passions, that is what life should be about. Congratulations!Well done! That is amazingThis is really cool and exactly the type of post I was planning to create at some point. I always struggled with taking that first step into coding and the people at Codecademy were thankfully generous enough to let me in with a PRO membership due to COVID aswell.
I’m at the end of my third week here and I can’t believe the amount of progress I made with Python. I have no idea how this newly-acquired skillset will affect my career in the days to come, since I don’t have a CS-related background to begin with, but learning a programming language has really changed how I look at things dramatically.
Congrats on what you achieved Bryan, and I’m sure that was just the beginning of many other you’ll hit in the future. Thought I’d share a summary of my journey here so far, and how thankful I am to Codecademy team for giving me the opportunity to improve myself!"

Here is what you can look up to, in case you are joining Codecademy as a learner, based on my experience.
@Codecademy team Thank you so much for the generous opportunity, making a difference in my learning journey.
As I studied, coded, and interacted with fellow colleagues and completed projects, I have developed foundational coding skills. It was simple and effective, with a team of fellow peers and Codecademy team always there to help.
Got stuck a number of times, but developed the ability to debug and make the code work to achieve the goal through the challenges encountered.
Happy to share that I accomplished the following within my learning goals:

Learnt SQL, Python and basics of machine learning models
Learnt A-frame
[Almost done with R visualization and machine learning]

Hope to get started with web development as well.
Surely there is so much more learning to do and practice to get better, but Codecademy has definitely been a great catalyst in the journey.
Love how everyone from peers to the team is so helpful.
Thanks for orchestrating such a wonderful learning experience 
Grateful for the opportunity.
Thanks,

Hello Everyone,
 Note taking can help you retain and understand the material better.
While you are taking a course, are you taking notes using any of these methods:

Inspired by this topic:  Making Notes 3
Feel free to share some unique ways for note taking.If I end up taking notes on a particular subject, I usually do it with an HTML page.A combination of analogue pen & paper, as well as an ever expanding cheatsheet of my own making which was started as part of the BYO Cheatsheet project…I don’t usually take notes, but I do prefer to take them using pen/paper. Then if I want, I might put them on an HTML page.I don’t really take notes, but I do remember heavily using Notes when taking the command line course.Mixture of temporary notes on pen and paper with some longer, cleaner ones written into text files that get fired into dropbox/github or similar.I usually use either OneNote or pen and paper. Pen and paper is just so fun for me, cause I can make my notes look exactly as I want them to and add cool details that make me remember stuff more easily lol wonder what other would mean Idk maybe singing the information to yourself?
‘Whaaaaat is the syntax for for for creatingggggggg a looooop in python- on- on -on’
Lol.Let’s see, I needed a catch all for the unique ways people capture notes. 

HTML
Drafting paper (from the inspiration topic)
Shorthand (from the inspiration topic)
singing 

I’m old school I guess(?). I have those wide ruled notebooks and take notes, draw diagrams, etc… I have lots of notebooks. 
But, if I’m writing functions (python) or loops, etc. I use Google Colab and create examples there so I know my code works/runs.I usually just have Notepad open. If I work on an exercise and want to copy the code down for posterity, I just copy it into my clipboard and paste it into Notepad. Name the file something like “TripPlanner.py,” save in a folder, boom. Since I do these lessons on my laptop, it’s just the most convenient way for me.
That said, if I want to try running the code later, I’ve recently starting using Colab because of school (in fact the whole reason I’m on Codecademy to begin with is because it was required for my course )"

I think it comes down to personal preference. I like using VSCode to write and debug my code. VSC can be customized by installing new packages and tools in it, so you should be able to set it up exactly the way you want. Just don’t forget that to run some of the interactive website stuff you’ll need to also install Node.JS in your machine.
Another option is to use online platforms like codepen, repl.it, glitch, etc. On this sites you can create a profile and start coding right away. The benefits of using these sites is that they are like Google Drive: you can share your progress with others easily and even invite them to edit your code live with you.
Good luck with your capstone project!"
400,Job opportunities,Learn From Home Club,3,1.1k,"hello guys,m=am sulub from kenya.I was wondering if someone can get a job in the usa after 6 months of front end development and how much much will be the starting salary??


 design1175133221:

how much much will be the starting salary?


This would be more of a pipe dream if it could be quantified. What research have you done so far with respect to,
1. Passport
2. Work Visa
3. Emigration

?
One suspects that it could be two or more years to wade through that process, by which point you would have devoted your time to studies and earning certification in your field.
Are you already in the US? Can you work? Have you spoken with prospective employers about expectations and job criteria?Usually people saying that Front-end can make around $20K per month, and if you wanna to looking for a job, make Portfolio right now with you contributions on Github and StackOverflow. for example, I had site on Github Pages (github.io 6) that allow me to make free Portfolio, when you commit on Github, It tracked your contributions on any repo.
StackOverflow also good to allow your employer to see your capabilities on some problem, If you master on something and understand the trouble, try to answer them. If you get upvote, it’ll record on your profile. (Same as Reddit upvotes.)
Also don’t forget to making your link on LinkedIn, ask anybody who you know or your colleagues to linking their connection with you. It’ll increase your chance to be pop-up than had nobody you knew.
If you choosing to do Front-end, better to do it on Home than going to USA for temporary, even IF SARS-CoV-2 is no more harm. better to saving your income then choosing to living on cheap and good location, such Japan, Singapore, or Canada than US. (you know what they problem are…)No way $20K per month. No way. Not even being a senior front-end development. Those salaries are for project leaders and administrative engineers or people like that. You have to have so much more experience to earn that salary in this industry not a six-month course or bootcamp.
Having said that I’m afraid of not being good at internships. I’m trying to get myself better on programming in general but I don’t know how to progress. I’m behind most of my collegues. Right now, I don’t care much about the money earned; I could work free for anyone. I just want experience and be good at what I’m doing."

Happy coding!"
402,The Project of Developing YOU,Tips and Resources,1,393,"Much like developing a code project, making yourself into a software developer is something that can’t be done in one sitting. What’s more, our enthusiasm about the idea of doing it is often at odds with our confidence about how to do it.
When we’re feeling lost, it becomes more tempting to give up. We’re in the danger zone!
We need to take a deep breath and realize that it takes time to become a developer. Just as writing an app involves putting together building blocks to create a more complex whole, we become a developer by learning skills that build on each other.
heirarchies of learning696×561 40 KB
The journey to develop a software project from scratch usually starts with smaller details. As seen in the example above, if you were developing part of an online shoe store, you might start with one simple function.
Perhaps you have a function to check the age of a user. This might go into a component, including the display where the user inputs the age. The age input form is part of the order confirmation module, which is part of the whole store, itself.
You start with building small parts and put them together to make something big.
Copy of areas of programming-Page-2791×791 24.5 KB
(Pictured above: a sampling of skills you might learn for Front End Web Development)
The project of making yourself into a developer also starts with small parts and builds them into a larger whole.
If you haven’t learned a coding language before, then you probably start with learning the syntax of a language online. Then you learn a design pattern, such as the React pattern taught in Codecademy’s React.js modules.
Learning a coding language is a bit like learning a spoken language. Learning to write good code and make things is more like learning composition, how to write coherent articles.
The main skills that you need to exercise or develop in this phase are studying skills, and the determination to practice. You should be doing a lot of example projects to reinforce your skills.
When you’re learning CSS, make static sites. When you’re learning JavaScript, make simple apps that do something. If you’re lost for ideas, google “____language projects.”
Around the time when you you’ve learned a language and how to program in it, you probably learn that you’ll want a portfolio of projects to help you get hired. When you start trying to make projects, you begin working on specific problems.
In every project, you’ll hit stumbling blocks where things don’t work the way you expected them to. From this, you learn persistence and problem solving. You get good at Googling solutions.
You should keep pushing through these obstacles to build your skills. Keep trying to push yourself with each project. Balance challenging yourself with staying within your competencies.
Push yourself but don’t break yourself.
This phase is like learning to use woodworking tools to make a nice piece of furniture. It’s all about learning to make a finished product with the tools you’ve learned to use. Your first attempts are not going to look like the best stuff out there. You have to keep practicing to get really good, like with anything.
Throughout the project of making yourself a developer, you are growing your ability to plan and break down the complex to move past uncertainty. You will face many challenges and low points. One of the best things you can do is stay connected to a community that can help you bounce back when you balk or falter!
You can’t do it all in one day, any more than you can make an entire app in one day. Many times, you may feel a ton of enthusiasm for the project but have no idea what you should do next. When you sit down to work, you might feel lost.
If you feel this way, it may be because, in that enthusiasm, you are trying to move in leaps and bounds. But it’s all about making little building blocks and putting them together one by one.
Don’t trip over yourself.
At any given time, try writing your goal on a whiteboard—or whatever medium you can use—and then see if you can break it down. When you have something that you can act on, it won’t be so hard to move forward.
Don’t be afraid to ask your community for help or for direction, as well. Just be sure to be tactful and polite, and people will be happy to help.
I hope this clarifies your attempt to tackle the big, complex goal of becoming a developer. Happy coding!Very good motivating article, I wrote some parts for myself on a papper, Thank you."

I’m starting Java and learning object-oriented programming. Hopefully I might change careers into computer programming.Today is actually not my first day anymore I had started to  code for 14 days continuously, but since I just joined, I think I will make it last until the 30th days of the challenge! hope there’s a skill that I can grab right by that time!!Hi there, it is really exiting to start coding.

I would say I am a bit proficient in C++ but I would love to develop my skills in PYTHON !! After Python, I’d love to explore Java…Hi, I’m coding for 15 days in a row here in Codecademy and really enjoy it. I’m in Web development path. I’d like to stay motivated and keep on track.It will be fast for you if you already know a programming language.New to coding, looking to make a serious change for myself and my family! Greatest challenge is motivation and focus. I’ve mostly worked jobs to survive and just get by, looking to rekindle my passion and do something more rewarding!I learn and practice as often as my mind and body will allow. The lockdown here in Spain is so strict that it has afforded me the opportunity to study for some hours at a time. I’m also unable to work (due to the impact of COVID on immigration processing) so again, I am afforded the opportunity to learn.
Perhaps most relevantly, I live with M.S., thus my inspiration to pursue a coding career is very much linked to requiring flexibility to work how and when my body allows me, rather than to somebody else’s schedule.
I am really enjoying the platform thus far and invite anyone who needs an extra push to get in touch. Sometimes the biggest challenge to progress is not having someone to hold us accountable.Looking forward to learning code while I have some time off from work due to COVID. For the last 3 weeks I have been on other learning sites. Some super easy while other were so advanced. I hope codecademy is some where in between.Work in DevOps but am not a coder ironically .  Hoping to change that over the course of the next few months.Hi, Felipe from Rio / Brazil. I’m hobbyist coder trying to get into Data Science knowledge and certification. Since this last 2 years I rarely was doing some code, so this challenge will be excellent to put me on track and with some luck get some work. Fingers crossed!

C# is at an all time high right now, being the language of choice for some of the most powerful game engines like Unity.
C++ has multiple game engines, including some top of the line ones like Unreal.
And though not as popular anymore, Java is still a good one in the world games, in fact I believe Codecademy has a course on making Android games with Java.
These are certainly not all of them, but it should give you a place to start.
I personally would recomend C++ and C#. They are easy to compile, run extremely quick, and can be compiled for just about any platform.Thank u man…can u help me with another one?
Can i make a 3d game look pixely style?I have not spent much time working with game developement, though I have heard Pixel for Python is a good one for this purpose. I believe you can make a pixel game in most game engines, since you usualy design the basic graphics your self.youll need models for the player and mabye the menu if u want it to look cool
also what are u going to name your game? what kind is it? is it multiplayer or single player?It gonna be a RPG open self generating world
Character is 3d object in 2d world and for simplicity,  i want it 2 look pixely type…and its 3rd personWell … now can i ask u guys another one pls?
After i learned the basics in java, what should i do?
i mean…the free trial is limited and it’ll teach u the main structure of the code…but there is a lots of other stuff i can learnright?
P.s : i cant affort 4 the pro trailI have not done… anything with java yet, so I can’t help you much with the specifics.
Personaly I find the best tool to continue learning about a language after you have learned the basics is Google (or the search engine of your preference )
You will find much has already been documented on just about every code language out there.
A good start would probably be downloading java for your computer if you don’t already have
it: java.com/en/ 1Thanks buddy!
I wish health 4 u and ur hole family and ur friends and people u love !
P.s:wash ur hands!What your project, let’s we say for your first is addictive games such tetris-like. You can using any language as long as it support on many devices. for this example, tetr.io is the good example.
Let’s we say you wanna try on engine, try Blender since it’s free and OSS, you can see the code, had Blueprint like UE4, small, and powerful. It combine Modeling, Animating, Rendering, in one place.
You had good income and wanna make good game. DON’T USE UNITY, since their free had watermark. they’ll say “Your game suck” indirectly (Even Cities Skyline and Rocket League using Unity, but still annoying).
You can using UE4 and making the graphic setting low and using Cel-shaders (Or toon-shaders to some people) and making Honkai Impact 3rd-like game on there.
If you asking on language, The question is “Are you planning on indie or go to big name such Ubisoft, Epic, etc.”
If the answer is Indie, you can use anything. But if you answer is AAA, then you can using popular one such C, C#, C++. they is always great for this big title since it optimize on Windows (and that’s why porting to linux bit harder. support Lutris and WineHQ).Hey there! 
Try checking on these sites, you can find several courses and tutorials:

405,Weekly Poll for September 8,Random,0,89,"  Welcome to our Weekly Poll 
Hello Everyone,
Topic:  Pair Programming
It’s where two developers work on the same block of code at the same time.  Typically, one developer is the typing and the other is observing.  It can be really helpful in situations where you are trying to show another developer something in their code.  It can also be a back-and-forth where you take turns debugging or working on different pieces of the same code.
You can find more information about Pair Programming here. 2

408,6/8/20 – NEW skill paths launched today!,Corner Bar,1,241,"Hello community,
Two Skill Paths went live today! Check them out in the course catalog. 2


Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript 7 – This skill path will help prepare you for technical interviews by teaching you the most common data structures and algorithms, as well as giving you several challenging problems to work through as practice.


Analyze Data with R 4 – R is a powerful language for analyzing and visualizing data. This skill path will teach you the basics of R, how to create visualizations, and conduct statistical analysis.

Any plans for challenge projects focused on R?  Or are any of the python projects appropriate to attempt in R?"
409,Lets talk about graphics interface,Learn From Home Club,8,156,"what are the libraries in graphics interface work with python?Tkinter is one of them. @subash3751749408  For more info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html 2what is pyopengl? please tell about this brieflyAh ah, for like games. Sure.
It seems pyopengl is not as up-to-date as C++ openGL. If it’s something you really wish to learn, I’d say go straight for it in C++. (Since it doesn’t look like python is going to be adding extra support in the future, and if you learn it, the more common type of use-case will be with C++).what is pyqt5? please tell me about this , i install it but how to use with python, how qt designer file use in pythonSeems you could also do some research on PyQT? Or any library you consider to build your graphical application. There is a lot of information available on the internet.
You can’t assume we have experience with all these libraries, given the amount of programming language and libraries each language has
I am sure there are people with experience who wrote comparative guides. Being able to do research into technology stacks you want to use, is a vital skill.
Don’t try to fit a tool for a job its not right for. Use the right tool for the job. In this case, you might want to use c++.Is tkinter actually used for jobs?I’ve never heard of it being used for jobs (doesn’t mean they’re not out there…), although I have seen some cool projects on it.

410,“Nothing Built Yet”,30-Day Challenge,6,412,"I’m currnetly 20% into C#, I haven’t had anything to do with code since high school, and back then I was using Macro Studio. I don’t even remember what it was called. It was some sort of Flash program to make games. I’m actually inspired when I log on to my home screen and seeing this on the side:
“Nothing Built Yet”
“As you learn, we’ll recommend Challenge Projects to build”
It really inspires me to make something functional as I progress with this 30 day challenge. I’m really excited. I’m going to work and coming home, hitting the keyboard and givin’ 'er. I don’t know what Codecademy has me build as I progress, but I’m looking forward to finding out.
I really, really wanna learn to make something useful or fun or whatever, just something myself or someone else can interact with.
STOKED! Lets do this Folks!Yeah. sure bro. I have started the 30 day challenge. Hoping to build somethingWorking on Python here. Total noob to coding. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous to fail. End goal is to be able to utilize my understanding of coding to work on Robotics kind of stuff, but I don’t think my understanding is quite there yet. Good thing I’m 19. It’s already kind of embarrassing that there’s kids half my age working on Arduino and Python projects, but better late than never!  Working on that 30-day challenge, too. I’ll check back in here daily to see how everyone else is doing.Just remember everyone starts somewhere!
Keep focused, absorb the material, enjoy the process!
One big thing though, don’t be afraid of failure, welcome it and learn from it. Stuck? walk away for 30 mins, take a shower (seriously, this helps more than i’d like to admit), or take a break. The expert level knowledge won’t come to you right away, but at least you’ll have the expert level mindset to deal with the problems that are ahead Same here here bro, looking forward to building projects using C#.Hi,
That is the best thing I’ve read here. Honestly, everyone’s comments here we too ambitious. I liked “remember everyone starts somewhere”

413,Does Codecademy have a public Github that we can contribute to?,Bug Reporting,1,80,"As title says, does Codecademy have a public Github repository that users can contribute to by raising PR’s/issues?
I ask because I’ve noticed a few typos whilst doing some of the courses but raising a bug request each time I find one seems a bit overkill. So I was wondering, if the content was on Github, it would be easier to raise a PR then someone could review and potentially merge.@munroe4985,
Great question.  Codecademy does have several public repos here 3, but it looks like they only include the lesson solution code and not lesson text.  I assume this is so that learners can’t just go to Github and read all the content from there without signing up for a Codecademy account.  So for now, it looks like if you find typos in the text the best course of action is still to submit a bug report."

Welcome to the Codecademy Forums!If you wanna making code for AI and ML, then the answer is yes. BUT, you also need a code of ethic and limitation to making a AI. even if you wanna make AI that doing something mundane automatically, you still need to control them on closed-environment.
It doesn’t mean it not fun. If you can do python or other AI ML language, you can defeat best person on something or even making mundane life easier. such defeating GO player or just making auto-tracker to tracking your consumption and activity.
AI ML is also a wet-ground. if you had Degree on Data Science, you can be AI ML researchers. and they willing you to pay you more than Data Analyst. and if you AI is good, then you can helping a lot people in their life.
For first project, just try to making productive AI apps, where the apps can combining many thing such Alarm, Diet tracker, Scheduling, and Daily Motivation. I think this project would be huge success.Thank you for the comment and I am interested in helping civilization into a healthier and at ease life. I am freshly new and just studying up on everything and every possible ground. This comment I really appreciate how just starting with the baby steps can lead somewhere which I have.

HINT: What I’m asking for is, if possible, something like “you can do this keyword see here some_link” I’m not asking for specific hacks, though they’re welcome  but rather that you point me in the right direction. Hope this makes sense to you and sorry in advance if it doesn’t.I see a lot of repetitiveness which could be eliminated using functions, parameters and arguments:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6212219/passing-parameters-to-a-bash-functionThanks for your reply and the link. Will read it and see what I can get from it. Yeah, I’m well aware of the redundancy on the code but I can’t figure out how to make it simpler, better. I tried creating an array but failed, guess need to read more about it. Thing’s I can’t find a way to solve  how to place/assign the ls command output to a variable so I don’t have to repeat it every time, I’d like to do something like somefunction/variabe=""ls*.{extensions to list}"" I just don’t know the right way to do that, been reading a few posts, blogs, here https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/start here https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html a couple of books I have here as well as some other tutorials on the web.I believe parsing the output of ls is frowned upon as it isn’t robust when dealing with spaces and such. You’ll find a lot of discussion of that particular point. Using find and looping might be a better shout if it’s complex (or the -exec flag is quite handy for simpler quieries).Thanks for your reply. Not sure what you mean with ""
ls is frowned upon
Well, the thing with using find is that it searchs for files recursively and I’d like to avoid that since that is a 1TB drive with lots of files, thus the output will be extemely long, dificult to read and navigate.I’d advise you to look it up as it’ll be explained a lot better than I am capable of. You can add something like -prune or -maxdepth to find to reduce it’s wasted recursion or you can only pass directories of interest. Personally for something more complex than this I’d avoid bash entirely though that’s coloured a lot by the fact I don’t often make use of it and therefore have a limited knowledge of its use.
If you’re determined to write it so as to practice in bash you could consider performing the task in a language you know well and then porting it over. At least then you’ll have an idea of exactly what kind of tools you’ll want to be using. After that it’s just reading up on how to make use of them such as the functions link provided earlier.

Yes, you’re right. I’d completely forgotten find does have those options, after all, I don’t use it that much either.

Actually, I’m not very knowledgeable/skilled at or in any particular language. I use bits of code from here and there and try to learn by examples. I’m no coder or developer whatsoever. I’m just a regular user who wants to learn some coding so I can do some basic stuff. I started learning python a while ago too, here in codecademy but got stuck at some point and haven’t taken over it ever since. I also started learning html a while ago but got stuck at some point too, coincidentaly, both times when reached the variables topic, I have really a hard time trying to understand that, I think’s because the examples available seem to be made for sysadmins or intermediate-advanced users in mind but not end/regular desktop users. I use Linux by the way, Debian Buster but have another couple of systems installed too: Debian Bullseye (testing) and Arch Linux.  Anyway, Thanks for your reply. I’ll read on how to properly use find and see what I can get from it. "
417,Could there be free courses for high school or younger students,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,6,97,"I’m a year 7 in high school and it is insanely hard to find resources for beginners on the internet. School doesn’t offer courses for younger years and our education is broken. I went to our school’s coding club and everybody was playing games, including the teacher and I was the only student who was serious about learning. I’m sure many others feel that way so PLEASE think about making courses free for younger students. I’m sure that I will get lots of sarcastic replies but this is worth a shot.Codecademy rolled out a new discounted student PRO subscription program just a few days ago. It is available for post-secondary students.
For high school students, I believe free PRO memberships can be provided through your school if your school uses clever.
Check out Codecademy’s new Student Centre 2 for more.i dont think my school uses clever sadlyIs the clever thing only for the U.S?Yes, I believe Clever is only for American schools.Well, that’s a disappointment. I’m in Western AustraliaYes, unfortunately, schools need to sign up using Clever for their students to gain free PRO access. Once you go into post-secondary you will be eligible for the discounted PRO student subscription.
In the meantime, Codecademy offers several free courses that I recommend you take a look at. Here is the entire course catalog."

All lessons are free to access, however, a PRO subscription is required for access to quizzes and projects. You can find the course here 1.
Codecademy’s Node.js course requires a PRO subscription. You can find the course here.
Welcome to the Codecademy Forums!Thanks for the help but I don’t think my parents will let me purchase pro, Are there any other resources to learn?As I mentioned in my previous reply, all the lessons the Codecademy’s JavaScript course are free.

Did you go off-platform and do your own project?
Did you help someone else? (ie: ‘teach one, two learn’?)

Excited to read about everyone’s win(s)! I have an 83 day coding streak and r/n I’m going back over the web scraping lesson and trying to tie together what I’ve learned elsewhere & here b/c I want to build a scraper and get data from The Met.   There’s also some really cool data vizzes from students at Parsons. One can kind of get lost in all the browsing. It’s pretty cool!I’m excited I was able to finish my SQL course. I love SQL so much. That, and my streak on Codewars (those challenges aren’t easy!).LAST WEEK OF SUMMER?! oh man 
This week I got into (or should I say my Dad got me into) AI/Machine Learning, so I came here to Codecademy to learn as much as I can from the topic. I found this really cool article 4 here in CC, and I was like “Dang, this can truly be applied to personal interests.”
I started the 30-days challenge (and I lost my previous streak )
Also I baked cookies twice this week 
The first ones were terrible (and burned) tho  But for some reason my Mom really likes burned cookies, so she ate them all 
But I think the new cookies turned out much better lol (sorry Mom, no more burned cookies)Congrats! 
Also, I agree about CodeWars! I get stuck often.I can’t wait to get to the ML part.
What kind of cookies? Chocolate chip cookies. I usually use gluten-free flour for making them, but then I decided to try a different flour (almond flour) and…it wasn’t a success lol. And even if some (like 4) of the cookies didn’t get burned, I didn’t like how they tasted

I decided to try a different flour (almond flour) and…it wasn’t a success lol.


I think it’s fair to say that as long as your mom like them, it’s a success 
Also I’ve heard Almond flour takes some time to get used to using.My win this week was going for my first run in 14 months yesterday.  After a soft tissue injury last year I got used to not going for runs, and anyone who has been there knows that starting to work out again after a hiatus is tough.
Code-wise, I’ve been really trying to do better about using Github and making reasonable sized commits and better commit messages.  In the last 3 weeks I haven’t gone more than two days without pushing to a Github repo and I’m starting to see a lot more green    on my contributions graph.Aha, yeah probably 
Well I don’t plan on even trying to get used to it. Screw almond flour  I’ve used coconut flour in baked goods before and liked the results. It demands lots of eggs though. If you’re gluten-free maybe try buckwheat flour. It’s a little pricey sometimes but it’s really good. (I’m not g-f, but I like to experiment w/different flours). I’ve also roasted chestnuts and made flour from that which is good as well. Oh! Thanks for the suggestions, they sound good

Most of my commit messages make sense for about 30 seconds then are useless… but then, nobody but me reads them… I should probably change that.

Did you learn something new?
Did you complete a course?
Did you help someone else understand a coding concept they were struggling with?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins!  Me?
I continued to code every day and have a 41-day streak. Whew!  I’m going to keep plugging away at the Data Science path. Excited to learn about Machine Learning & NLP (things I know 0 about).I can’t wait to learn ML but I have to wait a bit till I finish my current projects My win? I got to see some members of my family I hadn’t seen in a loooong time, mainly because of the pandemic. It made me so happy to see them again  Oh, wow! That’s awesome you could see your family.
I certainly miss mine and my friends who I’ve also not seen since March.

My Win… 76 Days Streak


76?! Dude you’re amazing  I could never maintain such a long streak lol Big win this week: after what it feels like an eternity learning and practicing, I finally got my feet wet contributing to some projects. I can say with absolute certainty that I will take coding all day on a project over studying ANY DAY 
Also, I made some mango lassi on the blender and yuuuum!

Mango Lassi really . Here in my Country it’s actually the Season of Mango and we just make all sorts of Drinks with it. We made Mango Panna this time. For that you need Green Mango and boil and mix it. The Sour Taste is just .
Here’s a Tip for you which is very beneficial in Covid 19 -
Vitamin A and C are found in abundance in mango peels. These vitamins help in building the immune system of the body.

I also won’t be able to make the streak if it wasn’t for you guys. Always Learning and going ahead. I wanna be like you all I newly joined the community and excited to start learning some of the interesting courses here. I was also certified by the discobot. Welcome @kosiok buddy, it’s Nice to meet you too.

That Great, I will also give it a try😋Nice to meet you too. Yah, bot’s tutoria; seems exciting.Just completed the Web Development Career Path while on a 103 consecutive days streak. It’s really motivating to keep it going and plus learning a lot about CSS, React, Github,HTML and JS. Along with completing projects.
Now I’m going through the R learning path and hope to start another consecutive day streak.That’s quite an accomplishment! Good on you!
 Congratulation.That’s BIG achievement. Keep it upI am new to the programming community and I just started learning HTML and CSS! I am almost through finishing the HTML course and I still have far more way to go. So far, it is fun and I want to continue.  That’s pretty awesome!!That is awesome!

Did you fix a coding error?
Did you start a project on your own, using the skills you’ve learned?
Did you do something new?

Excited to read about everyone’s win(s)! I finished the regex lesson and am working on the census project now (70% through the DS path [yay]). Dare I say it, I like regex. I just have to remember the syntax. (I’m always forgetting a comma or single quote).  I’m glad I took notes!
Non-coding: I made toasted pecan cherry scones. Many of my favorite artists released either new songs or new albums  I mean, that counts as a win, right? 
But also I’ve been more conscious about how I spend my time, and no longer feel like “I could do anything I wanted today”. Just write down every single thing I do, and at the end of the day realize “Oh, wait, I did all these things?”.
Also, I just realized it’s not even fall yet and I’ve been living like if it were. What the heck.I created a working program using web parsing, and am learning how to build APIs.My jokes were prophetic! You’ll soon mistakenly talk to your friends in regex.I’m back in school as a CS major! I think the pivotal points for the decision was that this lull in time is as good as it’s going to get for that kind of manouvre. And it’s a good excuse to continue learning fundamentals without the burn of looking for a job right away.Baked a cheesecake for the first time and it tasted great! Now I have to perfect the aesthetics (it cracked at the top).
Coding related, an app I’ve been helping to build online got over 1k distinct users, so the team was pretty excited. I’m deep in React+Hooks now trying to be as useful as I can Last week I slipped quite a bit on my coding practice, but I’ve got back on track and have picked it back up which I count as a win!
Also decided to start looking into game dev, starting with C#. Excited to get going. Woo hoo! Just put some fruit on top to hide the cracks. 
You have an oven thermometer, right? Don’t open the oven door to check on it and once you realize it’s set, turn off the oven and crack open the door and let the cheesecake cool in the oven. My Mom does this & it works. Decided to learn code seriously. Putting this here so i can look back on the day i made the decision. Much love to everyone."

I think Pomodoro style lets you truly focus in something and make real progress, and then quickly recharge you energy by shifting your focus for a moment.
However, there are times when you just feel so clinged to what you’re doing that you spend hours working on it, and you lose sense of time. Its until you feel drained out that you stop working and take a longer break.
I honestly don’t stick to just one of these styles, it really depends on what I’m doing.
Anyways, what is your time management style when it comes to coding?


 yizuhi:

However, there are times when you just feel so clinged to what you’re doing that you spend hours working on it, and you lose sense of time. Its until you feel drained out that you stop working and take a longer break.


This is exactly what I do on a daily basis. My mom had to drag me from my room to eat something.Haha, I know that feeling. Although I’m not quite there yet with coding…I get lost in art I do a combination of both.
I wasn’t aware of the term “Pomodoro” to describe time mgmt.
I was thinking of the pasta sauce.  Hehe, no, not that kinda pomodoro 
I knew about it cause my Dad loves managing his time in the most efficient ways possible, so he knew about the Pomodoro technique. Until this day, I haven’t been able to figure out why they called it like that Looks like the reason it’s called “Pomodoro” is because the inventor used a tomato-shaped timer. 


en.wikipedia.org



Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. 
 The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely re...





I’ll do 25 focus, 5 break if I plan on being engaged all day. For myself, I found it to be the best way I can get to 9pm and still going strongOh. Well thanks for that One tip I use is to set small goals that are easy to accomplish and then easily exceed it with the idea that I am coding everyday.  The goal can be as little at 15min of coding a day.  Over time I have found that I can schedule in 2hrs a day without struggle.  On good days I find myself coding for more than 3hrs without any stress or anxiety.  I have found that coding too late into the night can be difficult because you get tired and may lose patience.  If this is the case it is best to think about coding and learning when you are rested, energized, and thinking more clearly.
Breaks can be good as long as they don’t derail your concentration.
Finally I will say that exercise is also an important part of coding because prolonged sitting is bad for your health.  I think taking care of your physical and mental health, to the point possible, will also make you a better student and developer. This of course, requires some level of discipline, but is not impossible.
Finally for motivation consider celebrating other people’s learning successes.  The virtual community and group focus sessions and webinars (even beginner’s level webinars) can be helpful and encouraging.
Hope some of these strategies and tips help you on your journey!And let’s not forget nutrition! A lot of people will sit in front of their computer for hours and forget to drink water. Staying hydrated will help you with concentration and stress. So many people forget to drink water regularly!Love that.
Setting smaller goals is something that definitely has worked for me. It makes me feel like I am achieving something, and that just makes me want to keep going.
And yeah, breaks are important but you gotta learn to control yourself, cause if you don’t focus you ain’t getting anywhere.
The exercise part is also very important, I myself still struggle a bit with that. (Especially because most of the activities I like require me to sit down for a loooong time).
Thanks for your tips Yes!  I second the point about exercise. I’m a huge proponent of that b/c one influences the other.
Stuck on learning a new concept that’s particularly difficult or have an error that you can’t figure out? Go outside for a walk (or run or bike, whatever).
I think it helps your brain not only take a break but helps you clear your mind and think in a different way. So when you come back to your studying, or trying to fix a coding error, you might see something that you didn’t before."

Just try to program regularly, and keep practicing. That is most important.Thank you very much.If you feel not productive or sometimes bit tired, you can doing by watching coder on youtube, such Joma, TechLead, LTT, and many more. maybe you wanna take out from coding, try LTT or maybe open stand-up comedian. Then when wanna coding again. you can setting your envi on good mood such calm music, motivated speech, or just doing new thing such making story, video editing, or even make Portfolio project.
With that, you not only productive as many hour you like, but also you can control your routine.Thank you very much!Usually, I program 30-60 minutes after every meal and generally feel very productive.

ThanksHi there.
You can play around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on your computer with nothing more intricate than a text editor and your browser.
That being said, if you want to play with them locally I would recommend a code editor. Visual Studio Code 4 is free, and is my favourite, but there are others like Atom, or Notepad++… you should look into them and see which ones take your fancy. 
On top of the material here, you could also try something like Codewars 16 if you wanted to be challenged in your understanding of JavaScript.If you are looking for some quick code challenges to apply your knowledge check out edabit. its Free!
https://edabit.com/challenges 29Thank you both, I’ll check out all of these.this looks like fun, definitely going to try it out. Thanks!Your Guide To Awesome Coding Skills:
When practicing:

Find super cool things on code-pen that you want to recreate (p.s. code-pen is awesome)
Find something on a website that looks super awesome and try to recreate it on your own (DevTools will help you out there) Can’t think of anything awesome? I find the dropdown menu that shows up when you select your icon on code-academy pretty interesting, and I want to recreate it tomorrow.
Google “practice CSS grid projects” or “practice html project ideas”, etc–you will find looooaaaaddddssss of materials. Loads.

Do the code_academy build challenges (and don’t follow the directions)
Make stuff up and make it on your local computer with a code editor (I use atom, its free and easy to use)
Do tutorials on youtube, my favorite are code ninja videos, its a dope youtube channel where some British guy teaches you a programming/coding topic and provides a follow along project to do while you watch it~ preetttyyy doooppeee

Play coding games (just look them up, there are lots. For example, I like grid critters and flex zombies)
Just keep creating! Even if its super stupid, just make sh*t up. The more you use it, the better you will become at it.

Hope that helps!I strongly recommend Codepen 5."

It’s been 3 month since I join this awesome platform. Thanks to Codecademy Scholarship Program to join pro! It was such a mind-blowing response from Codecademy authority to fight this Covid pandemic.
But like a fairy-tale now it’s come to the end point. I’m feeling heavy and sad but at the same time I’m excited! Because in those past months I’ve fallen in love with coding. I was a complete newbie. Knew almost nothing about web dev. world. In fact I got to know about codecademy in one of those Google search. I’ve tried freecodecamp before but couldn’t adopt the platform. With codecademy the story is different. I like almost everything about this platform. Such lively community, helpful moderator, world-class content and so on! I really enjoyed learning here.
Considering my background and financial condition, I might never knew what it really feels to learn from a world-class platform. But I did! And the credit goes to Codecademy. Now I feel different, confident and ready to take upcoming challenges. I learnt nothing fancy in these months, but got a clear idea on what to learn and how to learn. I now know I can do work on my dream. Most importantly I know I can be a developer!
I hope my detachment from codecademy will not be permanent but temporary. I’ll try my best to comeback here.
For other fellow learner, I want to say, Coding is hard, but coding is love too when you have the mindset to practice regularly with amazing support system. So, work hard on your reason and make the best use of this awesome platform.

After HTML, it might be an idea to also learn CSS (just as it complements HTML very well). You could also learn JavaScript, as that works with HTML and CSS. As for electrical engineering, I’m not too sure. A language like Python might help-it has data processing abilities, although I’m not too sure what you need for the engineering.
I hope this helps!Thank you, I appreciate it. I will consider this one. CSS and JavaScript definitely go hand in hand with HTML! Learning those will help give you a really good understanding of and basis for web development.

430,Career changer advice please,30-Day Challenge,4,431,"Hello,
Are any career changers here? I graduated in philosophy and linguistics. When I started on Codecademy I had never coded before, but i read about the need of data analysts / data scientists on the jobmarket. As i like maths and i have strong analytic skills, i tried Codecademy to get an impression. Now Im almost done with „Analyze Data with Python“ and i had a first look at SQL. Im thinking about which step to take next, as i still realize that my skills are to few on the job market. Im 31 and trying to start a career that i can live on finally. Im thinking about a bootcamp also. Is or was anyone In a similar position?
Thanks for giving me advice.I’m pretty much on the same position, though I’ve never had an strong math and analytic skill. Just started from a pretty basic point and achieved a 4 day in a row self challenge, what made me think on really putting some effort towards learning to code.  An extra motivation comes from a personal project, gives health to the pursue itself.
The doubt strikes: how can I migrate to this career?Hello, I am also on the track of changing my career to something more fulfilling and financially stable. I would say as a recommendation to sign-up for open-source projects, it will give you great exposure and experience, in addition to add some items to your portfolio. Network and if you don’t have Linkedin get on and look to join a few groups on there. The more you get yourself out there and network the greater chance you have to show off your skills. I’m new to the world of coding, however my experience falls in the realm of Professional/Leadership Development. I hope this helps and continue to move forward. In addition don’t forget your existing skills you bring to the table, see how your degree can be applied to your new career path, what edge do you have that others won’t have. How you may view problems is going to be different and an advantage. Having experience with linguistics can be viewed as having a advantage in communication within teams/collaboration. Don’t sell yourself short and always look at things thru a different lense! Good luck on your journey!You could also think about taking a graduate job, the pay won’t be great at the start but could be a stepping stone to something much better as you’ll pick up a lot of skills and knowledge.
I used to work in retail for a while, but got a graduate role at software testing consultancy. My first client had me learning software automation skills, automating frontend web applications, creating automated performance tests plus loads of other skills. My client eventually bought me out and my pay shot up, but even if that didn’t happen, I learnt a lot working for this client that I could probably have applied to many other places.
A lot of people who also joined this testing consultancy didn’t have a technology background, some had maths, music, others had biochemistry etc. so the degree doesn’t necessarily matter as much and they usually come with other skills, like having a strong analytical mind.Hi. I think you can find here a lot of people who joined the team for changing careers. I graduated in management, but my main profession is a writer. My son graduated in linguistics, and his course paper was about the localization of computer games in different cultures. I found it very interesting and even began to play some games  Now I want to learn more about game dev, and my first step is to learn more about 3D-design. In this case, I’m glad that my family always supports me with all my crazy ideas. I think this is the most important detail here.
As for an advice, don’t give up and move on. Eventually you will succeed!"

433,Correct JavaScript Syntax,Community,1,49,"Hi there,
I keep on noticing on the supporting videos that we get for the JavaScript exercises (i.e: Menu Maker vs Lodash Library) that the syntax of the coders changes, is that normal?
Like:

inRange(number, start, end) {
if(end === undefined) {
end = start
start = 0
}if(start > end) {
var temp = end
end = start
start = temp
} var isInRange = start <= number && number < end
return isInRange
}

Whereas the syntax on the Menu Maker is totally different:

addDishToCourse(courseName, dishName, dishPrice) {
const dish = {
name: dishName,
price: dishPrice
};
return this._courses[courseName].push(dish);
},
getRandomDishFromCourse(courseName) {
const dishes = this._courses[courseName];
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * dishes.length);
return dishes[randomIndex];
},
generateRandomMeal() {
const appetizer = this.getRandomDishFromCourse(‘appetizers’);
const main = this.getRandomDishFromCourse(‘mains’);
const dessert = this.getRandomDishFromCourse(‘desserts’);
const totalPrice = appetizer.price + main.price + dessert.price;
return Your meal is ${appetizer.name}, ${main.name}, ${dessert.name}. The price is ${totalPrice}.;

I didn’t have the sense of an unified syntax criteria across coders/teachers and I’d love to have a clear understanding There’s not one unified javascript standard that I know of. Different employers will have conventions that vary and one should be adaptable for a variety of conventions.
That said, the MDN docs do outline a “best practice” style guide. Also, javascript changes at a quicker pace than other languages (like Java, Python) so the style will also reflect those changes. It’s good not too get too used to one way in javascript.
If you learn a language like python or java you will get a better sense of a language that works with unified syntax (esp. python). My suggestion is to keep the mdn page bookmarked until you feel at home with it and try to make your syntax follow it… but don’t be too fussed if you see other people diverge.

I would add that the optimal mixing and time-organization of these during different phases of learning is an area of interest for me.
Then there’s also a dichotomy of creative vs. analytical (as in creating new models/environments/etc vs. analyzing existing ones).Aye, I definitely use most of these but some significantly more than others. One of the ones I noted is that I get little to nothing from audio on its own. I’d only make the most of it with a view of the speaker or what they’re explaining (lectures/videos even when predominated with slides are all good).It’s really hard for me to catch information from audio, just like @tgrtim said. I’d honestly prefer to have all the information laid out as text, so I can go back and forth, get a general idea of the topic from the beggining…reading just works better for me.
But also I really need to speak what I learn, cause sometimes I have a lot of nonsense in my head and I don’t even realize it untill I start explaining it to a “rubber duck”. And taking notes also reinforces my knowledge.
And of course, things will very easily slip out of my memory if I don’t put them to use, so I love making projects.It’s funny that I’ve now been out of college for several years, but I’m just now figuring out what my learning styles are while trying to learn to code. It’s like it’s so intense to try and learn that I have to figure out the best way for me to do it so it’ll actually stick. But hey, I’m happy!
I will say that intrapersonal and interpersonal are very dependent on the situation for me. The majority of the time I find it easier to learn alone, but sometimes talking to others really gets the motivation going and can help me to figure out some of the more complicated things."
435,Recommended Skillset for Entry-Level Development,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",6,363,"Hey all,
I started coding on Codecademy about a month or 2 ago and I’m currently working through the JavaScript course. I feel like I’m making good progress and have an established routine that I like to use for going through the lessons and studying. I know that learning JavaScript will be valuable, but I’m wondering what else I should learn once I complete this course. Anyone with some real-world experience have any advice or guidance? Thank you!What is your end goal, are you doing this for fun or are you looking to move into a job in software development?@peachesmotorsports efinitely looking to move into a software development job. I really enjoy it, so it’s fun for me, but that’s just a plus! Then you definitively need to look into:

terminal commands
source control
unit testing
Docker
Agile framework (you won’t be managing it, but you will most likely be part of it so you need to understand how it works and how it benefits you)

If you want to be a full-stack developer, you should also look into Node.I’ll check those out! Do you know of any good resources to learn these? Does Codecademy have courses on any of those subjects?
https://git-scm.com/ 2
https://www.docker.com/get-started 5
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/ 5

You should get used to learning from the source, in the future you’re going to have to learn a lot of things and the best documentation is usually already there.

Codecademy has a course on the terminal
for Agile there’s documentation everywhere, courses are not free

And then insert your code between the two rows of backticks:
 


here is your original code:

I will now give you what your code should look like with the errors fixed, you will be able to see what have changed for each of the variables and take the time to read the text you have on the left of your exercice page, they give the information for each variable on how to fix them or what could cause the problem.

      bool is_yes = true;

      string band = ""The Low Anthem"";

    }
  }
}


you can also click the yellow bar at the bottom of the exercice page to get a hint on what is the problem for each of them (they forgot to talk about lock, the problem with lock was that you cant use lock since its a keyword already being used in c#).
I hope this helps and ill come back to see if you have any other problem later ^^
P.S. the problem with is.yes is that it uses a point (.) inside of the variable wich is not allowed. You can only use underscores, letters and digits."

In the example above, we call the startEngine() method on the myFastCar object. This method call occurs inside the main() method. Running the program results in printing Vroom! to the output terminal.

The last sentence should be corrected to the following since the startEngine() method prints two statements.

Running the program results in printing  Starting the car! and Vroom!  to the output terminal.

thank youHere:




Before you start looking for a job Careers, Journeys, and Stories


    I’ve seen a lot of questions here about how to go about finding a job after completing a course, I wanted to share some thoughts based on my experience. 
Why am I writing this? Because: 

I’ve been where you’ve been, and I wish I knew this several years ago
I interview people and decide if they join my team (I’m a Software Engineering Manager), so this is what I look for in candidates

Let’s get the most common question out of the way. Can I get a job after completing a Codecademy course? The an…
  


Short answer- no (well in my opinion anyway). However, it is important to keep building your problem solving skills.Welcome to the forums!  It’s always nice to have another enthusiastic colleague.
It depends on the job but it’s safe to say coding is not enough. Coding is not enough for coding even. Depending on the areas you study, you will need fundamental control of that areas core topics. What @h1lo says is true that a common denominator is problem-solving skills.
Some other useful general skills are:

clarity of written communication
time management / knowing how to prioritize
teamwork (even if you’re a freelancer, you can think of the client/provider combo as a team of 2)
testing
version control
maintaining your “toolbox” of skills (whether it’s sharpening existing ones or adding new ones). This is important to stay relevant with the change in demands from the field.

Of course, I’m omitting the specific side skills you need for specific branches because those can extend very far for each type of branch. Nevertheless, they are necessary as well.I like to point this out specifically, because it happens to me to this very day. Reading comprehension. Just this week I had to read a set of requirements 6 times because I didn’t fully understand what we needed to do the first couple of times. I also continually find myself in the position (as QA and Engineering Manager) failing a story because it doesn’t meet the requirements, the feedback is usually “read point 2 again, you didn’t do that properly”.
I always question whether the requirement is clear enough or just vague, most of the time it’s perfectly clear."
446,Hardware,Corner Bar,5,108,"Now that I’m learning Python, I’m curious where I can learn about hardware. Any web sites or online classes that people think are good?What can of hardware are you interested in? Do you mean you’d like to know how a network switch works? Or the USB protocol? Computer components?
Or do you mean more DIY hardware like how you could build a simple system with sensors at home that counts how many times you open your fridge?Yes some place that explains the inner working of a computer from the micro chip and up.Not sure exactly how in-depth you want to go on the subject but the way I learned a whole lot about computer hardware was by studying for (and passing ) the CompTIA A+ certificate 1. The certificate is split into 2 exams, the first being almost completely focused on computer hardware.
The exam covers the complete basics (what is a CPU) to the more complicated (what encryption does a 802.11ac wifi signal use). There’s loads of study material available. One free and very popular one is Professer Messer’s YouTube series 1.
Maybe have a look at some of those videos and see if it’s something you’d like to pursue further.Perhaps this article will help? https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895 3
Otherwise, how about this course on Computer Architecture? https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch 1


 bbgmp:

Not sure exactly how in-depth you want to go on the subject but the way I learned a whole lot about computer hardware was by studying for (and passing ) the CompTIA A+ certificate.


 for the CompTIA suggestion. A+ is certainly a good introduction to computer hardware, and the cert is pretty well regarded in industry too. 
(Congrats on passing too, by the way! )"
447,What got you into programming?,Community,2,63,"And now, what do you like the most about programming?
What got me into programming was Python. When I was like 9 years old, I started taking coding classes in school, and I started with Python. I honestly loved it so much back then, I built so many cool games and learned to debug my code.
But now I’m more into developing apps. (I currently develop apps in Android, but I’m learning web development ). I just really like how there are endless things I can build, and how many problems of real life I can attempt to model and solve.
How about you? I would love to hear your take on this My mom. During the time when schools originally closed, she said I needed to do something other than playing till 12 on my Xbox. So she started a small coding camp and used the free trial of Codecademy Pro to get us started. I started Python but was learning it too fast compared to my peers so I started JS. I then decided to stick with Python, and started searching up career paths to take. I chose Data Science after watching the Codecademy video and just went from there. Currently enjoying SQL. I enjoy how there’s so much more stuff to Python, even though I completed the course.I started with vanilla HTML back in the tail end of the 90’s, but I spent a lot of time on the Internet back then on forums relating to MMOs I was playing. I quickly found static pages a bit boring, so expanded out into Perl (CGI) and original ASP which was just blocks of VBScript stuck in an HTML document for back-end processing.
I ended up writing a bespoke CMS for a friend who bought a domain around 2003, all in ASP with an Access DB for the data store… it was a bit hacky in places, but it worked well enough for a small blog site!
I stopped for quite a while, during which time things moved on considerably… but re-learning HTML5 and doing layouts with HTML/CSS rather than using stuff like the archaic <frameset>/<frame> tags wasn’t too hard. In comparison to some of the stuff I used to do, Python and JS have been a piece of cake."
448,Teacher Resources(2019),Community,4,335,"I really want to continue using this platform as a mainstay for my scripting class for the university I teach at, but having no way to manage student accounts, create classrooms or lesson plans and view student progress and see where they are getting stuck it’s a massive issue for me. Just simply having a link I can share with a list of users and see if they completed the task would be a start.
Thanks,
TonyHi @tonymorin, welcome to the forums. I think this post by Codecademy 22 can assist you.I am so unhappy about this. The pupil tracking worked really well but now I can´t use codacademy in my course anymore.I hear you, @cssplayer15390. We will have some good news for students really soon, but I don’t think we’ll have the teacher dashboard any time soon. What worked well about it?The pupil tracking. I also liked the old version of the javascript course better. I don´t understand why the pupil tracking (teacher dashboard) was removed. It worked really well and I am sure many teachers would have been willing to pay for that feature. I would have at least."

How to Build a (Web Dev) Portfolio
About this Guide
I’m a developer and I’ve been tutoring new coders for years, I made this guide to help make sense of what pretty much everyone says you need to build when learning to code – a portfolio.  Wanna know more about these guides (there are others), me, and why I made them?  See here.
Context
For a 101 overview on how to build a portfolio, watch this:
How to Build a Portfolio
The Main Page
A lot of portfolios have a single portfolio hosting “about me” site at their heart, something to showcase you and link out to your work, your LinkedIn, your contact details, and so on.  If that interests you, read this 455 and this 199 for some tips.
Inspiration / From Design to Site
First, know that in software development, designers do more than graphic design or making things look pretty, they can define a lot of the interactive functionality and user experience.  For more info on who does what on developer teams, I have a guide on that here.
If you’re looking for inspiration or to make portfolio pieces that are similar to what you’ll get on the job, try starting with taking designs and wireframes and making them into a websites.  Watch this 349 for info about how to turn designs into sites and this 179 for more info on wireframes.  Codecademy projects have lots of designs to follow, they include things like design specs which are industry standard (see here 281 for one of my favorites).  Find some more, free designs to bring to life here 155.  You can also clone a website and modify it to practice your skills, or recreate something with the same functionality as a web app you use.  Common examples of the latter include recreating Twitter (good full-stack JS video walkthrough of that here 98) or making a blog.  Just because they’re common examples doesn’t make them bad.
Quick note on cloning… with anything in your portfolio, make sure to not infringe on intellectual property, plagiarize, or otherwise pass off someone else’s work as your own.  You do not want to ruin your reputation (or worse!).
Still looking for more specific ideas?  Try these:

Community Web Dev Challenges are made to be as close as possible to the assignments you’d get in the real world as a developer, including the use of “user stories.”  They list prerequisite skills so you don’t need to worry about taking on more than you can handle.  First one linked here 250.
Codecademy projects in Paths are another great option, though they are part of Codecademy Pro.  The Paths chain together courses in the right order and have real-world projects (that is, mimicking real-world tasks you can expect in the future and doing them on your own PC) peppered throughout.  There are smaller Skill Paths 49 and the bigger Career Paths 35, specifically the Web Dev 36 one. This will serve you better than taking individual courses à la carte as with web dev all these subjects aren’t discrete, they combine.  Most of the content in the skill paths are also in the Career Paths, but if you’re looking for maximum practice, keep an eye on both and on the tougher “challenge projects” over in the practice tab on your dashboard.

Make the projects your own.  A lot of people following a guide to make a project or fulfilling an assignment feel like it might not really “count” as their own work for an employer if it’s just the 10000th copy of a standard project.  If you find yourself in that boat, I’ve got a solution for you – riff on it.  Copy the Codecademy project or whatever other project to your own computer and start modifying the design or functionality to transform and upgrade it.  You don’t always have to make things “from scratch.”

Hosting Your Portfolio
You’re going to need a place to host your work.
Hosting & Showcasing Your Coding Skills
If you’re in a hurry, the short answer about where to put your work is GitHub!  I wrote a guide on how to do all this here.  GitHub Pages in particular is a great free option for hosting websites.  Heroku is a wonderful free option for web applications, take their tutorial here 56.
If you’d like, you can read more about web hosting options here 49 and here 25.
If you’re really early on in your coding journey, you may find GitHub a bit complex, or maybe it’s overkill for a mini project.  You can use sites like Repl 43 or Codepen 43 to share some simpler “doodles.”  Just know that it’s not a true replacement for GitHub.
From Portfolio to Job
If you’re like 90% of the people making a portfolio, you’re doing it to get a job.  Read this 195 for guidance on what portfolio work can get you a job.  Reading the following resources may also help with specifically how to use GitHub / your portfolio to get a job:

How to Promote your Github Project 133
What you as a developer need in your GitHub 172

Dos and don’t for your design portfolio 156 (although this is article is meant for design portfolios, it can be applicable to developers too)

This discussion 57 on what an employer wants to see in your github
What an employer is looking to see in your portfolio 205


Not The End
Please reply to this thread with your own resources, advice, and feedback! I made this post a wiki so it can be updated and maintained by the community, I’m just starting them off.  See my other guides here.Hi, my name is Sulton.
To create a good portfolio website, is it a must to have a good foundation of graphic design skill ? Like creating design first in photoshop or somekind of graphic software like that to upload to our website ? How about we lets say “not so good” about this particular skill ? Cant I make a good portfolio website ?

Question for anyone, do you have any recommendations for a portfolio site with no relevant experience?  It might make sense to have one catchall ‘resume’ page, combining education and experience with appropriate images, or even a single page, scrolling portfolio with links or previews to projects hosted on Codepen?

452,"[Article] Pair programming: what it is, why people use it, and how you can learn to pair-program",Featured Challenges and Events,0,337,"Pair-Programming
Pair programming is useful to learn and experience, as the skills and collaborative dynamics used in pair-programming will come up when you’re working on developer teams or encounter a really tricky technical issue.
What is Pair-Programming?
Pair-programming is an Agile development technique in which two programmers work on a project at the same terminal at the same time. You can find more thorough explanations of how it works here:


Video: What is pair-programming? 16


As you can see from the video, pair-programming involves two programmers working in tandem, in specific roles of driver and navigator, to work more quickly and to share knowledge. There are many benefits to working this way, as you’ll see below.
Why Do People Use Pair-Programming?
Pair-programming is used to great effect in both educational and professional contexts. It is a useful teaching tool, a great onboarding tool, and an efficient way to plow through certain types of coding problems by applying two brains instead of one.


Article: What Are the Advantages of Pair-Programming? 6


Article: Pair-Programming - Why We Do It 2


Both of these articles are from the point of view of companies or organizations who use pair-programming on the job. You can find a detailed guide to how developers look at pair-programming in the article below.


Article: The Ultimate Guide to Pair-Programming 3


Pair-programming is also used in educational contexts by coding students. Take a look at this post and this one to learn about how pair-programming specifically benefits students.
How Can I Learn to Pair-Program?
If pair-programming is something you’d like to try, we recommend starting with this Brainpop tutorial video 5. It’s less than five minutes long and offers a good, more practical look at what we’ve talked about in this post.
You can also watch two Codecademy employees pair-program here 8. This video is a more detailed look at how the pair-programming process works and will show you how the driver and navigator work together over the course of an hour.
If reading about pair-programming is more your jam, you can read more about it in this PDF from Hunter College’s CS program 1 and in this Atlassian developer blog 1.
Once you’ve reviewed all of this material, talk with others! They can be a great help with figuring out when in your course of study you should try a pair-programming project and perhaps can even pair-program with you first one-on-one to get you accustomed to the process. Have fun!

454,Before Java,Learn From Home Club,2,140,"What should I learn before learning Javascript?Hello @digital4606319117, welcome to the forums! If you’re confident with your ability to learn new things, then you don’t really need anything. However, if you wanted an introduction to coding concepts, CC offers a course called something like Learn to code-which introduces the concepts of code.
P.S. There’s two different languages which have Java in their name-Javascript and Java. But they’re quite different, even though they both have Java in their names.HTML would be good. Maybe CSS also is productive. In my personal experience I only learned HTML before (I still don’t know CSS well-enough) and JS has gone good for me.
PS: I’ve also done the A-frame course and I have to admit I have problems with libraries tho. Frameworks are more difficult. But one step at a time."
455,End of career path is super dissapointing,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,158,"Hello,
so I just finished the Web Development career path and I really loved it!
However, the end of the career path is super disappointing! The certificate does not look too appealing and after finishing the last exercise you would expect some kind of animations or some kind of dedicated page where one is being redirected. Maybe a page that shows a video where you just get congratulated on finishing this long course. This page could also include the final certificate because at the moment after finishing you are being forwarded to the main page of the career path. And to get your certificate you need to go to your profile and search for it. Just from a UX perspective it would have been much nicer to be automatically forwarded to the certificate or get an option to download the certificate. And in general, you could also give people some advice on what they could do after the path such as projects they could work on or give advice on how to apply for a job as developer. I think that you can improve on this final point. Anyway, I really love the course and I think it was great! By the way, it is also a pity that there is not even a feedback form that can be filled out by participants at the end of course. I am sure you would get a lot of good input. I hope this is the right place to provide such a feedback!
Cheers

459,How do you learn online course?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",8,174,"i just want to know how do you guys learn online course especially codecademy, do you read the cheatsheet before try to solve the code? or read and write cheatsheet or even the code ?.
i just want to find the effective way to learn online course. Hi there! 
One thing’s for sure: everyone learns differently.
I would say take your time.
Don’t try to force-feed yourself with information, because the things you force feed to yourself will easily slip out of your memory later on. Speaking of that, don’t forget to think about how you could use what you are learning to make a project of your own. After using what you learned for making something that’s representative to you, it will be harder for you to forget what you learned.
Just curious, what Codecademy courses do you plan on taking? Another useful thing to do is to take notes while you’re learning it. Then, next time you get stuck, instead of going to the solution, read your notes, and see if that will help you. Also-like @yizuhi said, do projects when you can. They don’t have to be large, but as long as they are helping you remember the information you’ve learnt. A good website which gives you coding challenges is CodeWars 2.thank you for your advice .
i’m going to take Data Science and Building Machine Learning Model With Python.I usually follow a lesson and if I get stuck, open a new tab and search online for related help. In my experience most lessons in Codecademy are self-contained and reading the provided information is enough to get through the questions.
I think having to search for  documentation, additional information and examples of code is very common in programming, so don’t feel bad if you have to look something up mid-lesson: it’s totally normal and we all do it!Ooh that sounds cool! I honestly know nothing about any of those topics lol Another thing worth considering is to think about what general fields your area of study falls into. For example, the data science path is enhanced by learning fundamentals of statistics (and all the implied branches).Hi @coreblaster26147!
I sincerely recommend you to rewrite the sample codes. Rewriting the more complicated ones would allow you to better understand what’s going on and memorize the process. You can also try running the code on PythonTutor 1 (a powerful step-by-step debugging tool).same here "
460,"Python function with try, except, finally, and return",Corner Bar,2,337,"As we have observed in instructional content, technical literature, and official Python documentation, a return statement, when executed, terminates execution of the function that contains it, and delivers a value to the statement that called the function. Literature on Python also offers much information on handling exceptions.
See:


Python: Simple statements
– Within the above, note: 7.6. The return statement 1


Python: Errors and Exceptions 4
– Within the above, note: 8.3. Handling Exceptions 4


For practice, but at the risk of sowing confusion, let’s take a look at the following code:
# A return statement terminates execution of a function,
# and delivers a value to the calling statement.

# Which return statements will execute here,
# and what will be the output?

def fun(num, den):
  # How many of the return statements in this function will execute?
  print(""fun!"")
  try:
    return divide(num, den)
  except:
    return eggs()
  finally:
    return spam()

def divide(num, den):
  print(""divide!"")
  return num / den
  
def eggs():
  print(""eggs!"")
  return ""eggs function return value""

def spam():
  print(""spam!"")
  return ""spam function return value""

print(fun(42, 0))

Output:
fun!
divide!
eggs!
spam!
spam function return value

For practice, copy it, execute it, modify it, and experiment with it,  using Python 3. Can you explain what happens? In particular, which return statements executed, and why?
Feel free to post explanations, questions, and your modifications of the code.I think I got it figured out:


Spoiler Alert

When the fun() function is called, ""fun!"" is printed,
The try attempts to return the value of divide, which prints ""divide!"", but the return inside divide() fails due to a division by zero error.
Because of the error the except attempts to return the value of eggs, which prints ""eggs!"".
Here is were I am not entirely certain what happens.
From what I can tell a return inside a finally will override a return elsewhere. So it returns the value of spam(), which prints ""spam!"" and then returns ""spam function return value"". This is then returned to the print() the first called fun() and it is printed to the console.

What is interesting to me is that a finally seems to be able to both delay and override a return statement.
Here the finally delays a return so it can print before the function ends:
def add(n1, n2):
  try:
    return n1 + n2
  except:
    return ""there was an error""
  finally:
    print(""finally is doing somethin'"")

print(add(1, 2))

# prints:
# finally is doing somethin'
# 3

And here a finally overrides the return altogether` and instead returns its own value:
def add(n1, n2):
  try:
    return n1 + n2
  except:
    return ""there was an error""
  finally:
    return ""finally is doing somethin'""


print(add(1, 2))

# prints:
# finally is doing somethin'





 8-bit-gaming:

From what I can tell a  return  inside a  finally  will override a  return  elsewhere.


Yes, this statement within the except block begins to execute:
    return eggs()

In order for it to execute, eggs() must first be evaluated prior to the return action. We can verify that the eggs function was called by noting this in the output:
eggs!

Consistent with the quote above, the finally block executes, and the return statement within it terminates execution of the fun function, which prevents the return statement within the except block from completing execution.
Thanks for the two versions of the add function in your post. They illustrate, quite well, the points you made.
Others who read this, please feel free to comment, ask questions, and provide additional code examples.
Perhaps we can also consider whether the code in the original post is consistent with

Did you make/build something with concepts that you recently learned?
Did you clean off your desk or get your inbox to zero? (haha)
Did you help someone?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! I continued my streak and am at 55 days. I’m also now 65% through the DS path.
Non-coding related: I finally made some cookies (chocolate chip). I haven’t felt like baking lately plus it’s been really hot/humid here in NYC. I realize now rather than just melting the butter I should brown it next time. I had some gluten-free flour too and used that. I am not sure I’m a fan of it. It tastes odd to me. Though the cookies did taste better the next day after being in the fridge.  I finished a Coding Project I had been working on for many weeks, and thank God it was a success 
Now I can shift my focus back to Android Development…but since it’s been a while since I last got my hands on Android, I’m now taking the Android Development path here on CC to refresh my knowledge.
Also tomorrow I’m finally going to start watching the third season of a Netflix show I love (Sugar Rush) I coded from 9 pm - 1 am every night this week! I’m currently going through the Web Development career path. I just finished the JavaScript functions section and the challenge project. The FAQ forum threads attached to the lessons and code challenges are always super enlightening.  I feel more confident with logical expressions now than I did at the beginning of the week. It’s helpful to reflect on the week. Thank you.
Agreed! I think it’s helpful to pause and reflect on what one has accomplished and learned. It makes you appreciate how much you’ve learned and how far you’ve come.Congrats on your 55 day mark! I’m currently on a 61 day coding streak and it feels really great! I code from about 6:00am-7:00am every day and a little more than that on the weekends.
Non-coding related: I tried to bake my kids some sugar cookies and they taste and feel just like over-cooked pancakes!  Ich reached (my personal goal ) of a 101 days streak. Within this streak I finished the Web Development path and started the Data Science Path. And since I’m always a bit overambitious, I also have a 101 day streak at Duolingo (learning Spanish). Es una buena semana para mí.All over the shop this week. I guess the big win would be getting ALARM 5 sorted on my Pi. There are still some niggles with the cursor (based on the video driver so far as I can tell) but otherwise it’s performing remarkably well, even with an add-on laden browser. Aiming to get back to the cc paths for the rest of the week I think (hopefully with dramatically reduced energy consumption too ). Sadly the local supermarket no longer has a discount on fancy mushrooms so this week’s cooking has been very dull. Perhaps something sweet would do the job but it’s been hot and humid here too so it’d have to be refreshing rather than rich (what am I saying, rich heavy puddings are the best; bring on the sticky toffee!).i made potato soup that was rlly delicious and goodHi, I start to learn SQL, jejejeje. Happy for that.My accomplishment is extending my streak to 55days in a row.
And getting to 70% in the web development course.
I know I’ll get to the end hopefully.

In 2017, stackoverflow calculated that python would beat all other programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest growing programming language in the world. It is also considered one of the best programming languages for machine learning.
Why is Python so popular??

It’s easy to learn and use…
Mature and supportive python community…
Support from renowed corporate sponsors
Hundreds of python libraries and frameworks…
Versatility, efficiency, reliability and speed
Big data machine learning and cloud computing…
First choice language…
The flexibility of python language…
Use of python in academics…
Automation…

Conclusions-
Some of the reasons why python is growing at a supersonic speed. I hope this article has shed some good light on python language and it’s important. So if anyone asks you “why python programming is important?” you have an essay ready."

I think there’s an option to have a free trial period. It should give you enough of an idea if you like it or not.
Regardless, consistency and fundamentals are the key whichever path you take. Not a bad idea. can I cancel the subscription before the trial period is over and still keep the benefits of Pro?You will be automatically charged after day 7 of your free trial, so if you decide not to purchase PRO, you should cancel your subscription on the seventh day of the trial period.
I’m not sure if you will keep your PRO benefits for the rest of the 7-day trial period if you cancel before the 7 days are up, but I don’t think you would, since your subscription to PRO would effectively be cancelled.I am doing JS stuff only at the moment too.
I have found out that it’s good platform for learning and repeating the courses helps a lot (if needed).
There’s other options too but they are priced at same range and can lack some features that codecademy has. And some sites are just way too confusing, as they are not so clear as codecademy.

You guys have been really helpful, i am so glad I found forums!   @zipporahbrooklyn I also use Bluehost and WP, here I am talking about a Codeacademy project.
But when I am practicing with HTML, CSS, JS I just use VS Code and my browser (Chrome or Firefox).So I’ll break into several part. and this can be useful with your workflow or even helping you with tool capability.

Text Editor or IDE?

The answer is just using text editor than download full IDE such VS 2020. The good option is Atom by Github where had several plugins such emmet.io, Kite JavaScript, and built-in github. or you can using VS Code where it’s just downsize IDE-to-Text Editor from VS 2020, still had feature even had some benefit such .c/.cpp plugins.
They both can run HTML, CSS, SASS, JS, and many more. if your pc is not over 8GB, then try online IDE such codesandbox.io, codeanywhere.com, spck editor, or codepen.io

Location and Domain

For this, I’ll say Github, they free and it not only can be as tool to showing how many contribution on repo but also your Portfolio pages. just make (username).github.io on your repo and adding index.html. done, when opening the pages, they will direct to your index.html on master branch.

Git tools

GitKraken, This is free for personal and full feature with LFS, GPG, SSH, and commit tree. don’t forget to install git, git-lfs, gnupg or win4pgp, and other tools to helping you securing your files and sites.

Custom Domain and DNS with SSL

If you already had enough money or just wanna free custom domain, go to freenom, and cloudflare. freenom allow you to had 1 year free domain while cloudflare personal is always free.
If you had see such forestry.io, netlify, hugo, angular, react. just do it one by one. better to learn how to make style for your site with Figma, since their personal is free and unlimited, you can design your Portfolio and learning css and sass from reading the code."

Most companies terms and conditions say that you are not alowed to edit the program, occasionaly they may even revoke your rights to use the program. Choosing to hack most multiplayer games, can result in banishment from the server and revoking your right to use their code.
There are countries in fact where it is illegal to edit certain programs or jailbreak devices due to copywrite laws.
If you are looking for games to hack I suggest finding one that is either open source or already built to use mods.im using open source games not acutal hacksWhy not making some business by selling something you like such Motorcycle or Cars Part and making a web that directly paying you and tracking the buyer. It’s not only to making it as Portfolio but also as personal business.

With that site. when try freelancing on freelancer.com, upwork.com, fiverr.com. You can showing the client or target with that site. so you get good portfolio and also you had double income for your live.
When trying to joining Big Guys, you can give almost 90% of your business to your admin, then when you wanna pull your business saving, you had at least 2 or even 3 income from those project.
You can using freenom domain and put on github for free, and then using SQL or noSQL such Firebase to input consumer data. maybe wanna to beautify it with XD or Figma (since both of them free for 1 user), and also using angular or react. but better build on react IF you like to make static for temporary.
That’s my opinion. but if you like my idea. please share to anybody."
475,What was your win this week?,Random,5,104,"So, what was your win for this past week? (It can be coding-related or not!)

Did you finish a Skill Path or course?
Understand a difficult concept?
Help someone else?

Please, share!
Excited to hear about everyone’s small victories this week! I have a 69-day coding streak. 
I’m almost finished with the Hypothesis Testing w/Scipy part of the DS Path (67%). I finished it over a year ago but am going back over it. I think I’m afraid of learning Regular Expressions, which is the next part of the Path. There’s nothing to fear about regular expressions… after all we use them in our daily speech all the time. Like when we say, “early bird gets the worm”, or the children’s favorite ""(\\w)(\\s+)([\\.,])""… Just rolls of the tongue! Regular, everyday, common, American expressions.Oh, sure! Of course I started my next Arduino project a few days ago. I am working on a little game console.Me and my sister started a IoT course, we’re honestly enjoying it a lot 
Also, before I didn’t really think that having a coding streak was something very useful, but at the start of this week I said “You know what? I’m starting a coding streak”. Because I mean, even if I don’t code for hours every single day, a small but consistent habit can really make the difference.
So yeah, I have a 5-days coding streak "

So I lost my career due to the pandemic, and I’ve had no luck yet getting employed.
So I’ve decided to learn code to take steps in becoming a developer.
What language is the best to learn first in this regard?

Sorry to read that…
Well, to become a web developer, you’ll want to start with the basics:

Learn HTML
Learn CSS
Learn JavaScript

You should learn them in this order.
After that, you may want to deepen your knowledge with frameworks, libraries, etc. but we’re not there yet. Take your time to get the fundamentals right, and then move on to more complicated stuff.

491,I’ve been coding for years. Should I still consider a bootcamp?,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",2,151,"I’ve been coding for years basically working on a single website that has made me a happy livable income. I’m not left with much to do on it anymore and it has become very self-sustaining. I’ve tried making other websites, but they aren’t very successful. I’ve always worked alone. I occasionally hired Fiverr freelancers to things like high-quality logos. I love working with Node.js for the backend. I feel very competent with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and somewhat competent with React.js. I’m fairly rusty with PHP. I have basic understandings of WordPress and Ghost CMS, although I imagine a job focused on a CMS would be boring to me. Im pretty confident with documentation that is very simplified. E.g Mozilla MDN and React Docs. Documentation for Chrome V8 has been extremely tough for me to read. I usually don’t have much trouble picking up new technologies.
I’ve never worked any “real” job. I’ve only ever worked for myself besides the few months I helped my family member who’s a freelancing tradesman. I was around 14 and only did simple things like sanding walls, caulking, and cleaning. I only completed high school and haven’t considered college.
I’m wanting to find a job as a web developer. I feel confident as a full-stack developer. I’ve most enjoyed back-end development. I don’t design very beautiful websites, but I can definitely get stuff done. I’ve read plenty of success stories with new coders landing jobs within a year of learning. It seems like most success stories come from those who’ve completed a code-camp. Should I consider completing a code-camp too? I feel like I can confidently make any website so long as the front-end isn’t too demanding such as animations. I’m unsure of a bootcamp because I fear that I would spend thousands just to relearn 90% of what I already know. I had a similar situation when I got something like a scholarship for a networking course during high-school.
My knowledge as a web developer pretty much comes from YouTube, Google, and Codecademy. I’m thinking maybe I have missed out on a lot of concepts. It would be embarrassing to land a job through a solid portfolio, but when working with co-workers, they throw terminology and concepts at me I don’t know of. I have a friend who is a web dev who has pretty much done the same to me, but when I asked what the concept was, I found out I knew how to do it, I just didn’t know the terminology.
TL;DR
I’ve been creating websites for around 5 years and have no job experience. I feel confident as a developer. I now want a job as a website developer, but I don’t know if I should go for a coding bootcamp or go straight to applying. I’m looking at bootcamps because I worry I might have missed key concepts or something else important to the workplace. Though I worry about bootcamps because I worry to spend a lot of money just to relearn most of what I already know. My knowledge comes from YouTube, Google(documentation, articles, StackOverflow), and Codecademy. I think I have a pretty solid portfolio as far as example projects go.
Should I consider a bootcamp or go straight to applying?I’d say go solo (but I’m also curious to see what other people here suggest). Do brush up on the things you need to know. It doesn’t hurt to strengthen fundamentals.
The cons of bootcamps from your context as I see it

high cost
very possibly will give redundant knowledge (to what you already have)
you already have access and motivation to learn to whatever knowledge they cover that you don’t have
you have tangible years of experience, no need to “pad” further with a bootcamp (you can however pad your experience with different types of projects and collaborations).

Moreover they’ll always be there. You can decide to set yourself some period of time to do applications and fill the holes in your fundamentals. Even if you whiff on all the applications, after time you’ll probably already cover everything they had to offer.1
How about working in a couple more projects and submitting all your work to a senior programmer’s review?
You would pay her(him) for a few hours (cheaper and way more tailored than a bootcamp). And, since you can get stuff done already, she could even mentor you and help you to land some gigs.
2
You could (and apparently should) do some complementary solo training to complement your knowledge on other aspects of being a programmer.
I.e: grabbing a book to learn about clean code; reading good documentation online to be proficient with terminology, rehearsing explaining your code in front of the mirror, etc."
492,Getting my head round Javascript basics,Community,1,43,"Hey guys,
Hope you are all doing good? I have been plugging away at the Web Development path. Currently I am 11% complete (just to give you an idea of how far I am) I flew through HTML and CSS and feel pretty confident with the introductory lessons. I loved those subjects and felt like I was flying high. I have been tinkering around on my own little projects using HTML and CSS and felt really motivated.
However I have hit a bit of a brick wall with Javascript. I feel like I understand it on a basic level but it just doesn’t seem to stick. The terminology that is used when coding Javascript throws me too…
I guess this is a bit of a shot in the dark but has anyone got any advice on how to get to grips with it? Is it just a case of going over and over till it becomes clearer?Markup languages like html & css are easier to learn then a scripting/programming language like JS. So, don’t compare. That will only make you feel bad. Javascript is going take longer to learn.
Practice makes perfect. Also develop strategies which might help, some people might prefer flow diagrams. Other people might ask a lot of questions: What does this do? And why? What purpose does this serve?
Maybe consulting external sources when something is unclear. The external source might have explanation which makes more sense too you"

Switch working with conditionals is a wonky thing. I think in other languages they have to be a constant expression, but in javascript there is a way to do it. Look at these examples:
This won’t work:
let average = 50
switch (average){
  case average == 50:

But this will:
let average = 50

Thanks for the reply. I changed it up to what I thought would work after reading your reply to this…
still saying undefined
const finalGrade = (n1, n2, n3) => {
  average = (n1 + n2 + n3/ 3)
  switch (true) {
  case average <= 59:
  case average >= 0:
  average = 'F';
  break
}
}

console.log(finalGrade(0, 0, 0));
There’s a couple of other issue in the code:


case average <= 59: — doesn’t have a condition block

finalGrade() – doesn’t return anything. If you log it it will return undefined.
I think I have to create an alternate function or something with the average and input that in to my log of the finalGrade function some howJust return average at the end of your finalGrade() functionfunction sayHi(){
   let hi = ""hi""
}
console.log(sayHi());
// output: undefined

function sayHi(){
   let hi = ""hi""
   return hi;
}
console.log(sayHi());
// output: hi
Yeah I was able to successfully return the ‘F’ with a ‘if’ statement and a return. Still not fully  understanding the Switch statementsThis is what I had success with
const finalGrade = (number1, number2, number3) => {
    average = (number1 + number2 + number3 / 3) 
    if (average >= 0 && average <= 59) {
    return 'F';
    }
 };
 
 
  console.log(finalGrade(0, 0, 0))
@kbgratto I just wrote a little example to show you how you might use a switch in javascript with conditionals
function diceRoll() {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(6));
}

let firstRoll = diceRoll()
console.log(firstRoll)

switch (true)
{	
	case (firstRoll < 3):
		console.log('rolled less than 3');
		break;
	case (firstRoll > 3):
		console.log('rolled higher than 3');
		break;
	case (firstRoll == 3):
		console.log('rolled a three')
		break;
}
Awesome that helped a bit with applying to what I am working on. This is what I have so far
It is reading the number 20 in the console after running the code. I am looking for ‘F’
const finalGrade = (n1, n2, n3) => {
    return ((n1 + n2 + n3) / 3)
  }

let average = finalGrade()

switch (true) {
  case (average <= 59):
    console.log('F');
    break;
  case (average >= 0):
    console.log('F');
    break;  
};

console.log(finalGrade(20, 20, 20));
That is because you close the function after this line:



 kbgratto:

return ((n1 + n2 + n3) / 3)


Your switch is not inside the function definition.I tried that and still getting the number from the return of the finalGrade function
const finalGrade = (n1, n2, n3) => { 
  return ((n1 + n2 + n3) / 3)
    
console.log(finalGrade(20, 20, 20));

average = finalGrade()

switch (true) {
  case (average <= 59):
    console.log('F');
    break;
  case (average >= 0):
    console.log('F');
    break;  
}
};

console.log(finalGrade(20, 30, 20));
The problem is also with the return in that statement. When you have a return in a function, in returns the following expression or statement, in your case (n1+n2+n3)/3, and ends the function. You might want to look at storing that result in a variable."

I’m Mounir El bertouli , from Morocco . I just wanna some help from you guys to get started with PHP , i finished HTML / CSS / and i almost finish JavaScript fundamentals , any advices …
and i am so happy    for joining here in CodeCadmey forum.Hey Mounir,
Glad to read that you’re happy. You seem motivated, that’s great to see!
HTML and CSS is a good start. You’ll want to finish that JavaScript course before going any further.
Learning PHP shouldn’t be too difficult if you did well on the JS course, imho.
Any advice, well…

Take the PHP course here on Codecademy to get familiar with the language.
Always keep an eye on the official docs!
If you read blogs, articles, tutorials and whatnot, always make sure they’re up-to-date.
Start working with the latest release of PHP (7.4.9 currently). PHP 8 is also just around the corner.
Read all of this (yes, all of it): https://phptherightway.com 1

Read this as well: https://phpenthusiast.com

Always and only use PDO to connect to a database: https://phpdelusions.net/pdo 1

Once you’ve taken all this in (I would expect in a few months time), and while building little projects of your own, you’ll be able to start looking into frameworks. Now there are quite a few out there. I’d stick to the best of them, Laravel and Symfony.

How far you go after that is up to you.
Best of luck, and feel free to ask any questions you might have.

Previous doctypes looked something like
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""

As regards attributes, you’d add them to the <html> tag, not the doctype statement.
So you’d find
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">

These two are the most common attributes. dir=""ltr"" stands for direction = “left to right”. Not necessary in most documents. Would be interesting for languages that read from right to left (such as Arabic or Hebrew). But then again I don’t believe it’s ever absolutely necessary to use.
I’d personally just stick to <html lang=""en""> (or other relevant languages, of course).thanks yes i was mixed up about the attributes. i guess i saw another type of html. Thanks!"

 mega7615250309:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)


If you add 1 it will include 100 in the array (potentially), and will not include 0.
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1

or
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 1)

Either way comes out the same.



 mega7615250309:

sumArray += array.push(n);


There is a bit of a type match problem there. Isn’t sumArray an array? And, isn’t array.push(n) a statement?
There is a strong possibility that array.push() does return a value, the new length of the array, so in that sense it would be an expression. The .reduce you are working toward could be to set sumArray to a zero value, rather than an empty array. Then the above line would work, accordingly.
 > array = []
<- []
 > sum = 0
<- 0

       sum += array.push(i)

503,IBM/PC Day,Random,5,118,"Guess what today is!
IBM/PC Day! 
On August 12, 1981, IBM introduced their first personal computer, the IBM module 5150.
It jumped IBM up greatly in the computer industry, and set the standard for Personal Computr designs. Before long “IBM compatible” became an important thing when it came to computers.
To see the impact the module 5150 had on the computer world, let us do a little comparison.
In the early 1960s a single IBM computer required at least 1/2 an acre of airconditioned space, and about 60 people to operate it.
By 1980 IBM had release the module 5120, a great computer at the time, costing between about 9,500$ and 23,000$. It had a great nine inch screen, and 32K ram, and two, not one but two, 1.2 MegaByte floppy drives.
The module 5150 added much greater technology, its CGA graphics card, when paired with a good enough driver was capable of displaying through VGAi to much larger monitors.
It contained up to a 64 kB ram, and with the expansion chassi, it could power and use two hard drives. The expansion was shipped with a 10 MB hard drive, greatly improving its storage space.
Boy have we come a long way. And all thanks to the pioneers of the technology we have come to rely on today  . I sit and look at my laptop, with a 180 GigaByte hard drive, and a 14 inch screen, and I pause in amazement looking at how far we have advanced since then.
Only sixty years ago, a computer took up more space than most people owned, and cost more money than nearly all of us can afford today.
I can only wonder what will have another 60 years from now.

IBM Personal Computer

 The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version of the IBM PC compatible computer design. It is IBM model number 5150 and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers directed by Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida.

ah yes when computers looked like microwavesOr before that when a single one filled up a warehouse.It’s interesting to think, my laptop cost around 270 USD, it has a 500 GB HDD and 8 GB DDR3L RAM, and that (in my opinion) has below average performance for a modern laptop.
What’s funny is in 10-20 years, all the computer that nowadays are considered “cutting edge” are going to be way to below standard to really be used anymore.It seems strange how quickly computers become ‘ancient’, how quickly the technology moves.
Consider for example that the wheel has been around for about 6000 years, give or take, and they are often used in the exact same way. Yet our computers today, hardly appear similar compared to what we had less than a century ago.or before one took up an entire battle ship lol"

Thank you for your help  It helps me to understand that categories can be set up in a certain way but I’m still confused with the topic summary count of likes - there are 3 answers in the example and the number of likes summed up is 8, why is there 47 likes in the topic summary count?

The honest answer to that would be that I simply don’t know. I presume it’s a quirk of the forum software, but exactly why there’s such a large difference between the number of likes on the replies and the count in the summary is something I can’t explain immediately.

508,Front-end and Python,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,136,"I’ve recently discussed with a friend of mine regarding coding careers advice. I’ve covered the Python 2 module, learned about NumPy and Pandas in the “Analyse Financial Data with Python” and am planning to apply for junior coding jobs soon.
My friend advised me that I should make a couple of projects of my own (basic full-stack), learn front-end development and learn how to use react.js.
I’m happy with doing my projects and going over react.js. The question for me is, what should I do to learn front-end development whilst using my Python knowledge to my full advantage?If you’re going to start studying front-end I’d suggest to get comfortable with vanilla js.


 toastedpitabread:

get comfortable with vanilla js


Is that a new framework I’ve not heard of? 



 java3423036957:

The question for me is, what should I do to learn front-end development whilst using my Python knowledge to my full advantage?


I’m by no means an expert, but to the best of my knowledge the intersection of “Python” and “web” falls pretty squarely in the back-end.
There are two popular frameworks for delivering web content through Python: Flask, on which there is now a Codecademy course, and Django. Both of these allow you to build the server-side app which serves up your content.
For the actual front-end content, though, you would need to know the web trinity of HTML/CSS/JS before you could use a Python back-end to serve up anything. @thepitycoder haha.
@java3423036957  “basic full-stack” –  In my opinion there’s nothing basic about full-stack. It implies a lot of knowledge on multiple fronts – plus the additional knowledge of efficiently integrating the different layers. Like @thepitycoder said, flask and django are great to integrate with html/css/js. It means you also have to know enough about handling databases. I wouldn’t try to throw react into the mix until you’re comfortable with javascript."

 designwhiz59651:

The advanced challenges are simply too much for someone who is new to Python without further instruction.


The challenges are meant to be just that: challenging. If you’re struggling, then I would encourage you to continue with (and potentially revisit) the material on your chosen course and to do some off-platform study before doubling back to the challenge project that has you stumped.
What do I mean by “off platform study”? Could be anything like reading the Python docs, or doing kata on CodeWars to practice with the fundamentals.Heya - thanks for your feedback. I authored these and we definitely hear this a lot. I can try to give you a little bit of context around these and also offer some advice.
I agree with you that these are much more difficult than our other content, and that’s because I don’t think teaching computational thinking is a central part of many of our lessons. A lot of our lessons focus mostly on syntax rather than teaching a way of thinking. This is something that we want to work on. I think projects try to be closer to a middle ground where we ask you to do a little bit of problem-solving on your own, and then code challenges are definitely the hardest.
We work off of Bloom’s taxonomy a lot 
Our lessons usually fall within the “understand” category, whereas I think our projects fall under “apply” and these code challenges fall under “analyze”. (And if you’ve reached the end of career paths, capstone projects try to get up to “create”).
We’ve also tried to make these less mandatory. These challenges used to be in lesson format, which would require you to get the solution for every challenge before moving on (In fact, I haven’t had time to port some of these into an article, so some of them are still in lesson format like this one 2. I would love to hear your feedback on the different formats once you get to some of the later code challenges). By making the challenges less mandatory, we’re hoping that folks feel like they can skip them and come back to them after getting some more practice.
Finally, I think these challenges are kind of cool because they’re more data-driven than some of our other content. These are genuinely ordered by difficulty - when I ported them over from the lesson I looked at how often learners were asking for the solution code for each challenge and ordered them from easiest to hardest. It would be interesting to take a look at that data again to see if it’s changed at all over the past few months.
So that’s all of the context around these, but I’m sure you’re rolling your eyes because I’m just throwing taxonomy pyramids at you but that doesn’t help your problem of still feeling like they’re way too difficult. So here’s some advice that might actually help:

These are tough. And on top of being tough, we haven’t really taught you this kind of thinking, so you’re going to struggle. But at the same time, I think this content is some of the most important content on our site. So one piece of advice is to use the lessons in a way that can prepare you for code challenges like this. Rather than just getting the checkmark on each lesson and moving on, use the code editor in the lessons to experiment with questions you might have. We’ll teach you the syntax that is correct, but you can do a lot more on your own. For example, if you’re working through a lesson on lists, we might teach you how to get a subset of that list using something like my_list[2:4]. Well, what happens if you do my_list[2:]? What about my_list[:4]? What about my_list[:-2]? How about my_list[4:2]? You can do small little experiments like that in your code editor rather than just doing my_list[2:4] and moving on - then when you come across a code challenge that involves getting a subset of a list, not only do you have more practice using that syntax, but you’ve also seen a few different edge cases.

Break the problems into pseudocode. Write down the solution in English and don’t even worry about the code. This will help develop those computational thinking skills, which are honestly more important than the syntax. For example, for the first challenge in the article that you linked, Append Sum, I might write something like “Find the last item in the list. Find the second to last item in the list. Add the two items together. Append the result to the list. Repeat 3 times. Return the list”. You now have a plan of action and can start writing code.

Start implementing the solution in code in parts. Don’t worry about getting the exact solution right away. Prove to yourself that you can do the building blocks of the solution. For example, in the Append Sum challenge, first prove to yourself that you can print the last item and second to last item in the list. Then prove to yourself that you can add those together by printing out that sum before even trying to add it to the list. If you feel shaky about adding an item to a list, forget about adding the sum of the last 2 items, just try adding something like ""test"" or 1. Prove to yourself that you can do all of the parts of the problem, and then start putting those parts together.

Hope that helps!If I could like that post more than once, I would…"
510,[Article] Giving and receiving code review,Featured Challenges and Events,0,348,"What is code review, and why do people use it?
 What code review generally is: Presenting clean, properly-formatted, polished block of code for feedback on a specific question, usually in regard to code quality, readability, correctness, or security. Reading and offering clear feedback on someone else’s code.
 What it generally isn’t: Sharing an early draft of unformatted code, and/or asking reviewers to check for  anything  wrong with it. Sharing a final  project  and asking for feedback on the project itself (instead of a piece of the underlying code). Rewriting or marking up someone else’s code outside of their specific request.
Many resources on code review are specific to a particular coding language or to a work environment. See if you can identify the common principles in the overview articles below.

Article: Code Review: Why It’s Important 1


This article covers why businesses and organizations like to conduct code review and peer review of code. To be clear, including this piece here is not an official endorsement of the product by Codecademy.
Finally, we refer you to this list from the Wikipedia article on code review 1 for this helpful list of purposes for code review.


Better code quality  – improve internal code quality and maintainability (readability, uniformity, understandability)

Finding defects  – improve quality regarding external aspects, especially correctness, but also find performance problems, security vulnerabilities, injected malware, etc.

Learning/Knowledge transfer  – help in transferring knowledge about the codebase, solution approaches, expectations regarding quality, etc; both to the reviewers as well as to the author

Increase sense of mutual responsibility  – increase a sense of collective code ownership and solidarity

Finding better solutions  – generate ideas for new and better solutions and ideas that transcend the specific code at hand.

Complying to QA guidelines  – Code reviews are mandatory in some contexts, e.g., air traffic software

How to review code
In order to maximize both the reviewer’s time and the efficacy of the review itself, there are several guidelines to follow in reviewing code.
 We’re presenting this section before the “asking for code review” section because we think that grasping what the reviewer will be doing and looking for will help you prepare your own code for review and better understand what to ask for.

Article: Mastering Issues


The “issues” feature in GitHub is incredibly useful for providing feedback on certain parts of a code base.
Asking for code review
Following the guidelines of the code review section 2 of the /learnprogramming reddit FAQ is a good place to start.
Its do’s and don’ts can be applied almost anywhere that you ask for help, especially if you ask in a public forum. There are online communities where you can ask for code review, but as you can imagine, they most often respond to people whose code and request come across as prepared and mindful of the reviewer’s time. Again, we’ve found that the most pertinent advice here is to be specific with what you want to be reviewed – don’t just send over your entire site and repo and ask for general feedback, point people to smaller parts of your work or isolatable things that you’re trying to accomplish. After all, code review in the workplace doesn’t involve reviewing code for an entire project, they’re split up in smaller, digestible chunks like pull requests.
On that note, with a multi-person project, you can create a Pull Request on Github and ask for review there. Note that you’ll create a Pull Request to ask a specific person to review your code on Github. You can also post your code for strangers to review on Reddit, provided you follow the guidelines above. You or ask on the Stack Exchange forum specifically created for code review.
If you’re a beginner, we’d recommend sticking to the above locations at first. If you’re a more experienced coder who already has been active on Stack Overflow, that may also be a good place to ask for a review.

512,[How to] Format code in posts,Getting Started,1,13.5k,"Codecademy Discuss posts are parsed with Markdown 114. Markdown allows for easy formatting of code and text, and strips HTML out of posts by default to prevent security risks. This will show you how to format your code so it shows up.
Summary
To format code so it’s visible, either wrap it in single backticks (``` ``) for a small amount of code, or triple backticks on an otherwise blank line before and after for a large amount of code.
Details
Inline code
To indicate a small span of code, wrap it in backticks (`). For example:
How do I use the `console.log()` function?

would produce:
How do I use the console.log() function?
Code Blocks
Toolbar Icon
Using Preformatted Text icon on the toolbar
Screenshot%20(29)_LI701×104 15.8 KB
This will automatically create a code block which you can paste your code in.

Or select your code and then press the icon.
Manually
To indicate a code block, either wrap the entire block in three backticks:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata and external resources-->
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Or, (2) you can indent the code with four (4) spaces:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- metadata and external resources-->
      </head>
      
      <body>
        <!-- page content -->
      </body>
    </html>

The first produces:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata and external resources-->
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>

The second produces:

522,[Learn more] Community Guidelines,Getting Started,3,71,"How Can I be a Good Citizen of These Forums?
Use the guidelines below and FAQs to keep this a clean, well-lit place for civilized public discourse around learning new skills.
The following are are not hard and fast rules, but merely aids to your best judgment for navigating our community.
How Can I Improve the Discussion?
One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening.
Please spend some time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.
Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
The Do’s and Don’ts
✓  Do format your code before posting.

Do make sure you post your question in the right category.
Do make sure you put the instructions, error and link to the exercise you are stuck on in your post.
Do make sure you put the exercise number in the post title.
Do ask for help if you need it!

✘ Don’t ask for help on an exercise without posting code.

Don’t post your question more than once - a moderator will move it if needed, so you don’t need to repost.
Don’t start debates
Don’t advertise. Not for services, nor other groups or communities.
Don’t post external links non-code related
Don’t post full working code without explanation.
Don’t give out personal details.
Don’t use bad language - Keep it PG here, please.
Don’t ‘revive’ topics that are old.

What is Codecademy’s Integrity Policy?
We do not, under any circumstances, tolerate cheating or dishonesty.
Please do not post answers, or ask for them.
Some people may help you by posting some code or showing you errors, but the goal of which must remain helping another to learn; cheating is not tolerated. If we see anybody cheating we will delete the post, and, depending on the circumstances, possibly ban your account.
How Can I be Agreeable, Even When I Disagree?
You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid the following:

Name-calling.
Ad hominem attacks.
Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
Knee-jerk contradiction.

Instead, you are encouraged to provide reasoned counter-arguments that seek to improve the conversation.
What Tools Are There for Participation?
Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions. Including:

Bookmarks
Likes
Votes
Flags
Replies
Edits

Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too. For more in depth information on tools available to you, please see here.
Let’s try to leave our park better than we found it.
How Do I Flag a Problem?
Click the flag icon under the post to notify moderators. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.
Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.
When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. Just flag it.
NOTE: In order to maintain our community, the moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.
Always Be Civil
Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

These are not concrete terms with precise definitions — avoid even the appearance of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.
This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.
Keep It Tidy
Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
Don’t post no-content replies.
Don’t post messy, unformatted code samples. Learn how to format code

Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
Don’t sign your posts with personal contact information — every post has one click access to your profile.

Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

528,Race Day - Web Development,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,0,102,"Hello,
I would like to say I am a beginner and I just started to learn how to code so I can’t provide you guys with too much information but I would like to make a suggestion. I finished the "" Race Day "" project today and I found it very hard to follow to steps provided in the tutorial, therefore, I will post my solution here at the end.
I found it very hard to follow the steps because in the first place the “raceNumber” variable should be assigned only after the conditions are verified and it shouldn’t be provided at the very start. Secondly since you do not know when a person is going to be either an early registrant in the race or not and you are not provided with the criteria that defines one I made a new variable “earlyRegistration” that generates a random number between 0 and 1 (true or false).
Therefore I would suggest the steps and objective of the project to be rewritten so that it will become easier to read and understand the requests of the project.
I found the challenge quite entertaining and appropriate for my knowledge level so I would not suggest for it to change.
If by any chance this topic is useless because there were some things I was not aware of when I created the topic I ask an Admin to delete it.
With kind regards,

Hi!
I just took the quiz. I’ve coded on and off for a few years and been a musician as a profession. I think the quiz got what’s the least fun part of programming for me.
My advice would be to try one language for a few weeks (2-3) while practicing a solid hour a day and see how it feels to work with that.
Python for example is a great flexible language that would be easy to translate to other languages if you decide you want to switch.Hello! I’ve taken the quiz and have gotten “Problem Solver” as well. I agree with @toastedpitabread that Python is a great language to start off with. I completed the Learn Python 3 course here and really enjoyed it.Based on the description, it sounds like a Software Architect. The Computer Science path is a good way to go. I got User Advocate 2, pretty accurate for what I do which is actually not in the Career Opportunities.

Anyway I hope I could accomplish this challenge and hopefully you guys too. If you could, please share your thoughts on your challenge experience.Welcome! Best of luck!Hello!  Thanks for sharing your experience! I’ve had a similar experience.  I was using video lectures to learn coding as well.  Although I found them to be informative, I do like the codecademy approach to teaching material more.

(I know it’s Tuesday and weekly polls are normally Mondays.  )
Feel free to comment below.Bingo! I’m interested if you all have some favorite podcasts. The only one I listen to regularly is Talk Python To Me but I’m all ears for other good ones (any language/technology).I have voted, however I feel there’s a glaring omission from your poll choices which should be the go-to for anyone who is stumped when it comes to their chosen language/framework/popular JS library…
Never underestimate the power of the official documentation. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve posted links here to learners asking how to do something which were to nothing more obscure than the language documentation. Python’s documentation is excellent, as are the docs for Swift, Kotlin, Java… and MDN is an excellent source of documentation for the web (HTML/CSS/JS).
Being able to find, read, and comprehend the docs is an essential skill in my opinion. “talk to myself”
that is 100% correct. 
I also consult official documentation for python, pandas, seaborn, etc. Though, sometimes it’s not as clear as it could be (IMO) and it just seems dense. But, after a few pass throughs and looking at other explanations, it makes sense (to me).You are absolutely right!  I do find, however, if you’re not really sure of what to look for in official documentation it can be daunting.

I hope this query be undestandable to all of you and thank you for your attention.
(Greetings from Argentina  )Hello! There shouldn’t be any required prerequisites, as if you’re planning on learning from CC, they give many paths/courses which help you get started with programming, before you begin learning a specific language (or a few languages in a path, etc). You might want to do a few Google searches about the different languages, to find one that you think might suit you.
I hope this helps!


 codeneutrino:

You might want to do a few Google searches about the different languages


To give my opinion on this, I think focus on choosing a path. It’s easy to spend hours looking for the language you should learn. Focus on what you are thinking of doing, web development, data science, etc. and the languages you choose will support that.
For example, I chose Data Science, and find myself quite enjoying working with Python and SQL.


 h1lo:

Focus on what you are thinking of doing, web development, data science, etc. and the languages you choose will support that


Very true!
I should have clarified what I meant; I meant do a bit   of searching (maybe 10 minutes) to see what type of things you can do with coding, and therefore what general language to use-as in HTML/CSS/JS if you want to do web dev, or Python and R for data analytics, etc.This 4 is what I was taught before I wrote my first line of code.
This 3 should help you choose a path."

Steps to Reproduce: Use == instead of .equals().
This exercise is all about comparing strings for equality using .equals(). However, the exercise allows you to pass each step using == instead of .equals(), which would normally be erroneous since == does not work with string comparison for equality in Java. Using both == and/or .equals() will work to advance to the next exercise, but it should be limited to .equals().

537,Confusion,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",4,126,"Hey Everyone!
I’m still a bit of a noob here, so please bare with me.
A little about myself:
My professional history is in the military and accounting/finance, and I have a degree in Religious Philosophy.
I’ve always had a creative streak, and now at 35 I’m trying to figure out a career path that will help me feel more fulfilled.
Initially, I thought Web Dev made the most sense. I have an eye for detail and I love to create. BUT, recently, a friend of mine in the industry suggested I get my foot in the door via UX Design. I don’t really know what to think. I’m not a designer by any means…I’m just a nerd with a photoshop and camera habit.
Does anyone have any insight or advice?
BenHonestly, that’s not good advice. UX and web development are related, but at the same time they’re completely different.
UI\UX (User Interface\User Experience)
These people do 2 things:


Make things pretty -> you need very good skills in photoshop or whatever tool allows you to make\edit graphics. A lot of designers use existing generic assets and modify them, but good designers build their assets based on the application. You also need to build schematics to present the design (pictures alone won’t do it). The big unmentioned factor here is that you need to have “taste”, basically your design needs to be pleasing to the eye, what colors go with what, how do they relate to the company and the marketing strategy (you also need to provide assets to marketing).


Design the user experience -> given an action to perform, what does the end user need to do to perform it. What to click on, how things are presented, how a process flows, how to handle errors. You have to anticipate how an end user will use the application and provide the best experience possible. Pro tip: the end user will always do something you don’t expect, how does the application manage that?


In some cases it involves managing feedback sessions where you present the design to a designated target, collect their feedback, and make improvements before releasing a feature to the public. This sounds easier than it is.
Web Development
Developers take the designs created above and write code to make it work.
Both things require different skillsets and while they are related, you don’t see a person doing all 3 unless they’re a solo freelancer. It’s a lot of work, and it’s not efficient for 1 person to do all of that on a project. It is not an obvious or easy transition to go from one to the other, at least in my opinion. This is why companies have a development team and a design team. They work together, separately.
Having said that, it is a good thing for a designer to know CSS and HTML and developers usually have input on the user experience.
Only you can answer the question, What do you want to do?Man. This is awesome. Thank you so much for taking the time to illuminate this for me!
What do I want to do? Wow. Excellent questions. I want a career where I can create cool stuff  I have dabbled in web dev/design and I even messed with software dev a little. I really enjoy seeing my code work, but I also love working in photoshop and taking pictures. I suppose it makes more sense for me to pursue Web Dev…that will allow me to create things, but I feel like doing front end work will also allow me some creative space. What do you think?Sounds like you should focus on front end development, CSS is very important. Not only to make the app look nice, but you need to manage it efficiently in the code. Not all companies have a designer, let alone a good one. You can supplement that deficit, to an extent.You’re totally right. Thank you for helping me think through this! At 35, making this change is a big deal and it’s a lot to process."

Hey!
I’d just say, there’s no rush to be a specialist right away at the point you’re at.
It’s a beautiful thing, so take your time to experiment and be open with different routes. In your experimentation, try to be “honest” and don’t skim through easy exercises… meaning try to deduce what core concepts are being built, and what implications it can have (an exercise is only as basic as one’s approach to it).
Some of the most popular languages in CS are Javascript and Python. But there is a world of other languages out there that can engage your mind/inspiration if you take the time to look (for me, I wish I were younger so I could put more time into learning C and Haskell without worries).
And don’t forget about aesthetics and design. If that’s your jam, CSS, Blender, Photoshop, etc can be things that interest you (or not, it’s really for you to figure out).
The internet has a ton of great learning material so take advantage: IRC, discord, youtube, reddit, scribd, podcasts, newsletters, and real books are all legitimate ways to learn and have your ears to the ground in the field. Computerphile is a fun youtube channel that shows you a wide cross-section of people in the field doing neat things.
Don’t forget that people you already know fit into the picture too (they might not work directly in computers, but many will probably have potential needs for applications and web services relevant to what they do). And people you meet along the way can can also fit in in surprising ways.@toastedpitabread Awesome thank you! Yes I often find myself in the forums here, and I understand there is SO MUCH to learn. Baby steps, I guess. Thanks for your input!
Commencing 30-Day ChallengeBut here’s the distinction (for me anyways). They seem like baby steps when you’re young, but they’re giant steps if you do them right. They might not look awesome to outsiders, but consider them awesome for yourself.
I used to perform and teach a lot of violin. I could always tell from the first 2 months who was going to be an incredible player in 5-8 years simply by how they approached learning (and it wasn’t because their talent was superior, often they were average talent-wise, sometimes even below-average, but their learning mentality helped overcome those initial bumps). There were edge cases where as well, but those that start off badly and persist still come around to the point where fundamentals are a key asset. Obviously, it’s the teacher’s job to encourage everyone to get the most out of it like this!@toastedpitabread
I just completed the 30-Day Challenge, and I am so excited to look back and see what I’ve learned!! And that’s just in 30 Days?! What?!
I’m finding a lot of enjoyment out of this, especially when something which takes a while to click finally clicks!! I haven’t yet dabbled in anything besides Python and maneuvering through my system via Command Prompt/Bash, but I think I’m going to play around with Java next. Class/ starts in 3 weeks, so I’ll have to figure out how to get coding into my work/school/study/play schedule. I have no doubts that I’ll make it work.

547,Anybody Else Finding the Web Dev Path Very Tough?,Corner Bar,12,595,"I’ve completed the Data Science and Computer Science career paths and have now moved on to the Web Dev path. I’ve been surprised by how much tougher the Web Dev path is than the other two. Specifically, once I got to module 10 (React) there seemed to be a pretty steep increase in difficulty. Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if it is just me, maybe web dev just doesn’t click with me as much.
Obviously there is nothing wrong with it being difficult as programming is a difficult subject in general, but again just caught off guard by how it differs from the other paths and wondering if it is just the nature of the path/web development in general or if it may be something on my end.I haven’t done the full Web Dev path, but I did the JavaScript Back-End Development and it was difficult. I spent a lot of time reading documentation and code trying to understand how to do the projects and even some of the lessons. I also think it’s a little strange that they put front-end development before back-end in the career path. I would think front-end would be easier to grasp with a foundation of back-end.I have been doing the Web Dev path for a few weeks now. I have been working hard on it and doing as many of the modules that I can. I feel like I have learned a lot, but I have no real world knowledge of how I would implement what I have learned into a project of my own. Following the steps is fairly simple, but learning to use what I have learned on my own has proven to be far more difficult.Implementing the skills outside of the projects in the course seems to be the most daunting thing. I’ve only been doing this course for about 10 days and from what I’ve seen so far, it holds your hand a lot in the projects.
So I’ve started to try and re-create them by myself. From scratch. It takes much longer at times, but I get much more out of it, because it’s not just about following instructions anymore, but figuring out stuff for yourself. It doesn’t have to be perfect or a huge project. Start out small, mess around with it, build on it. It’s terrifying, but will get easier with time (I hope). 
Good luck!Once you get to around module 10 of the course it starts holding your hand a lot less. I think that’s what is making it seem so tough. Some of the later projects are really rough in terms of figuring out what they are looking for and how to implement it. But as you say, hopefully you get more out of it that way and it will become easier with time.I figured as much. But I guess it’s one of those “learn how to swim or drown” things. That’s why I’m trying to mess around with everything I learn from the beginning so I’m ready to tackle the harder stuff when it comes around. Also: Google is your friend.  It might not help you figure out what the exercise wants from you, but it might help finding what you don’t get a grip on and give you an aha-moment or two.
Good luck!I can confirm that it does hold your hand less the further you go in. But, it got the a point to where I understood the code when reading it, but had no idea how to finish a challenge without a hint. The Node JS section completely lost me. It got to a point where I couldn’t progress further without just running the solution code. I ended up putting the rest of the course on hold until I feel more comfortable with the courses content.One additional thing I’ll note is that when you get to module 13, the X-Press Publishing cumulative project appears to contain several bugs/issues that make the project difficult to complete (ex. because the files you have to work with are old, you have to download an older version of NPM to work with them). I’ve noticed this kind of thing in a couple of other places in the course as well, which I think is adding to my frustration given what we are paying for our memberships.I am going through this now! How is/did everyone handle this change in difficulty/assistance? I find myself googling and watching YouTube videos a lot now to get a better understanding.
Anyone have any suggestions that they think helped them get through React modules and beyond?  I can’t wait for everyone’s feedback. Thanks in advance.I don’t suggest letting the modules be the only way you take in the information.
Documentation, youtube, irc/discord, note taking (written, visual, and audio), podcasts, and books are your best friends! Personally I find reference books go a long way, and some good ones can be accessed through subscription services (scribd, packt). I often just buy one if I really need to know the subject well, as they can cover a lot of grey areas (though you have to check through forums that you’re getting a really solid book).Yes, I recently completed the web developer path, and it got WAAAY harder once getting to Express and Node especially. Gratingly so… I got through it, but had to look at solutions a lot and kept wondering why it was so much less enjoyable than the preceding parts. Coding in general is fun, but Express??? Ugh. JS testing was pretty difficult too, but with the help of Google it went okay.
As some mentioned above, the projects to do off platform are also hindered by the fact that they use old versions of the packages. My computer wouldn’t even load them it just froze every time I tried to npm install for a X-press or expresso, beat-mix, and a few of the others (these may not all be in web dev, I jumped around a bit).
Having everything server heavy in the end of the course definitely slowed down progress and demotivated me a bit, but by then you are so close, it’s worth it to keep going! I agree, try to find other projects to do that help you to progress. Sometimes it helps to go back over the basics. for me reviewing apis, and dom events has proved very helpful to me. There are a lot of websites with front end challenges if you don’t know what to make. Sometimes reading what other people’s code helps you too because as you try to understand it you look up things as to why certain things run the way they doI finished the Webdev path last week. I have mixed feelings about it. Although I learned a lot during that course, some parts were very frustrating. I think the course needs a tiny overhaul. X-Press Publishing is the best example for it since it is buggy from the start on. I also remember the Loadash project that left me with a ‘WTF did I just learned and why’ feeling. The React course was great and also a bit frustrating. But I was so enthusiastic about React that I started learning it on Youtube. Thanks to Codevolution and other people I learned all about Hooks, Bootsrap React, React Spring, Axios … and btw. about using the spread operator (why not here?).
And this brings me to my suggestion of the day: I really like the approach from Codecademy to teach people these kind of thinks. But maybe you can connect some parts of the path like creating a website, using Git to publish it, using React and API calls (with MongoDB or the public Instagram API) to end up with a really cool “About Me” website. And every once in a while you have a look on some parts of the course because the world of coding develops fast.
And if the Webdev path has a Product Owner: Think about getting feedback from the people after each chapter. A star rating would already do it and I’m pretty sure a lot of people would like to give more feedback. You would be surprised what you can do just with natural language processing to analyze messages from customers to improve the User Journey."

 Solved by 8-bit-gaming in post #16 


                The error has been corrected!! 

I am uncertain if this is actually an error, I believe it is done this way so that they can fit everything on a single line, and the quotation marks are to designate that it is a string.
It doesn’t ask “what was printed to the console”, it asked “what is the output”. I will certainly ask about it though.The exam is following it’s own conventions. It’s a pedagogical choice, which I think is ok.
Quotes to explicitly refer to strings, and no quotes refer to variable/object names.
They have to follow some convention, otherwise there’d be some contradictions like:
What’s the output of this? (when it’s variable names instead of strings)
drink_choices = [coffee, tea, water, juice, soda]
for drink in drink_choices:
    print(drink)

The test answer would be

coffee tea water juice soda

If they didn’t use quotations for their example, this one would fall apart, as there’s no way to contrast it.
Alternatively they could use # comments to clarify type and all that. Hmm, but maybe that would be more clumsy.You can force quotes to be displayed in the output by formatting drink variable with f-string:
drink_choices = [""coffee"", ""tea"", ""water"", ""juice"", ""soda""]
for drink in drink_choices:
    print(f""{drink!r}"")
I’d have to agree with you,  @jonher937. None of those are correct. We are left to choose the least incorrect answer. If they didn’t have room enough for the correct answer, they probably should have  asked a different question.f-strings have not been covered at that point, strings is the chapter after loops.
Also your example would produce single quotes and not double quotesIt’s already quoted in the list (so the value is a string).
Adding quotes around the output that is not actually there is not pedagogical, it’s incorrect.
The section before loops is lists, so this should already be clear from doing the Lists chapter.For me it’s just inaccurate. I wouldn’t write it like that. Literally, it is 100% wrong. What I meant by the pedagogical note is that they may be trying to highlight this type of stuff (hence why I still there’s some degree of a point trying to be made, again, in a clumsy way):
>>>drink_choices[0]
'coffee'

>>>for i in drink_choices:
>>>    ""coffee"" in i
True
False
False
False
False


But I agree that it’s not accurate. Moreover, many of their other exams don’t have a problem using multiple lines in the answer, so it’s not a hard fix.
Again to clarify, my thinking it’s a pedagogical choice doesn’t mean I think it’s a pedagogical choice well-delivered upon. What I meant about it being ok, is that I think it’s ok to make pedagogical choices (but it defeats the purpose if the clarity is muddied up).Since it has been agreed on as a bug, could you post a link to the quiz so I can report it?Sure, here it is: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/quizzes/python-loops 2
The other questions in the quiz that should also contain newlines are just separated by space like this:
2020-08-01-190534_scrot858×516 19 KBF-strings is not taught at Codecademy at all. I just wanted to show that there is a better way of manipulating strings then what they teach here. I guess I got too excited and posted the code example without completely thinking about it. I am sorry about that. But it does not change the fact that there is a better way to format strings then the methods covered by Codecademy. When you study Strings, you will learn about escaping similar characters and what to do if you do not want to use it. These two code examples will demonstrate these two concepts.
drink_choices = [""coffee"", ""tea"", ""water"", ""juice"", ""soda""]
for drink in drink_choices:
    print(f""\""{drink}\"""")

or you can do this without using escape characters:
drink_choices = [""coffee"", ""tea"", ""water"", ""juice"", ""soda""]
for drink in drink_choices:
    print(f'""{drink}""')

I hope you will find this info useful. And good luck in your studies.F-strings are fairly new (relatively speaking) which I guess is why they aren’t covered. I do find myself using .format from time to time when it reads easier but bigging up f-strings certainly isn’t a bad thing. I think both are worth knowing.Especially when they do not have to anything extreme, like upgrading underlying python version, in order to teach f-string. They already running compatible Python version 3.6.7. And you right that it worth knowing both methods. The biggest con with f-strings is that they will not work with empty curly brackets and .format will.I just reported it! Thanks for posting this!


 parzivalkei:

The biggest con with f-strings is that they will not work with empty curly brackets and .format will.


I don’t understand how that’s a con. What would be the point of placing empty curly braces in an f-string? Perhaps a better way to ask would be why would you want or need to put empty curly braces in an f-string?The error has been corrected!! "
549,Is moderator a paid position?,Random,7,1.4k,"It’s evident that moderators log in massive hours…
There is certainly a non-numerical reimbursement part, in the form of kind words and badges.
But is it enough?
Sometimes you really have to listen and try to understand what is the issue. I am not talking about the misspellings and missing spaces, but questions like what are objects, what does a function do, why is there a return here… etc. The answers have to be tailor-fitted, and something like that takes time.
I have a massive amount of admiration for all, moderators and non mods, who keep this forum going by answering the seemingly never ending (sometimes repeating) questions.
I would like to single out moderators, you invest so much of your time into this endeavour.
What keeps you going?No, it’s not paid.  The moderating team are just friendly individuals who help out in their spare time. 
@moderateursYes, it takes time. But it is satisfying being able to help someone else 
But as a moderator you need to have good understanding of multiply languages/concepts, but if you will pay close attention you will see that we are a bit selective. I very rarely answer jquery questions for example.
Thank you for the compliment. The team is also great, i appreciate that, and it really helps. We can help and support each other, and learn from each other.
So yes, time consuming but also rewarding. Maybe not in the form/shape of cash, but money isn’t always the most important thing Thanks for noticing us @puristaja! 

What keeps you going?

The interesting questions. The type that take me a long time to think about, or make me learn new stuff in order to explain something to the person asking. I don’t have any great examples right off, although I did enjoy answering @nickgrimes50’s question about if statements recently (I should have remembered how if statements work, because I’ve checked if a variable is true or false plenty before, but because of the context, I completely forgot and got to spend some time re-teaching myself that ).
When I see a learner thinking about how something works and asking a question that hasn’t been asked before and makes me think, and then I’m able to answer their question satisfactorily, it’s a nice feeling.

Also, I feel like this can be viewed as a bit of a “Pay it Forward” thing. People help me when I’m stuck, so then I help others when I can, and hopefully they continue that and help teach even more people

553,What’s the point in using HTML and CSS if you know Bootstrap,Community,5,98,"Why not just depend on Bootstrap and copy paste stuff. I guess it’s because html and CSS can be more flexible in terms of design.


 dinnosam:

I guess it’s because html and CSS can be more flexible in terms of design.


You are correct there.
Also, although one can design entirely with bootstrap, in the place of HTML and CSS, this is not truly programming, it is more along the lines of kiddy scripting. You copy/paste lines of code because you know they work, but you don’t truly have an understanding of the programming language.
If you desire to build a single wesite quickly because you need it for a buisness, or something similar, than sure copy/paste the code. However if you truly desire to learn web developement, than a solid knowledge of how HTML and CSS work is essential.
“What’s the point in using HTML and CSS if you know Bootstrap”

…because without it you’re likely to be reliant on a Bootstrap template vendor to make anything even vaguely interesting, but won’t have a clue how to assemble the “pieces” that Bootstrap provides yourself? I guess you could copy and paste stuff - but that would require you to find the exact snippet for what you want.
Bootstrap is a collection of “ready to use” web snippets, but it’s all just HTML/CSS/JS that someone else wrote for you. You’d need at least a rudimentary understanding of HTML to assemble something vaguely functional in Bootstrap, probably.
If you were just after an easy way to assemble a web page without having to learn the languages of the web, there’s plenty of site builder tools out there from various hosting providers… and there’s WordPress.Would the style of my site change depending on Bootstrap, cause I noticed a link to a stylesheet to a Bootstrap href?Bootstrap uses a set of styles in order to display the way it does. When you link to Bootstrap you are telling it to use their stylesheet, and if any of your elements end up having a valid selector within that stylesheet, than Bootstrap will style them accordingly.Ohh that’s wild "

Well Python does have a few good pros.

It is easy to learn as its syntax is quiet similar to spoken language.
It is open source, any one can use it and modify it free of charge.
It has many, oh so many, modules that can be added to it so that one can have it tailored to their needs. These include, data processors, game engines, GUIs, and more.
The advanced user can add make their own modules to add to it.
It has great online documentation, and a large community. Because of this it is very easy to find the information you need on a specific subject.

Do note though it is not without its cons:

It is a relatively slow language, since it is compiled on running it, the computer must process it before it can be run. This is contrary to a language like C++ which is compiled before running.
Installing modules for it can be rather difficult, though it is not always.
It is a very high up language so for the most part it can not control a computer as efficiently as a lower level language like C or C++ can.


Over all though it is a great language. It is good for beginners learning to code, it can be used for many things ranging from web developement to AI, and it is great for if you need a custom program built quickly for a specific need.
I would certainly recomend at least looking into it, if not learning it.Good To Know! No wonders the syllabus for Python here, seems really extensive though with respect to the Data Science path.I’ll add my own thoughts although @8-bit-gaming put it very well.
It’s a good starter language in that it’s used a lot and learning it gives you a lot of good habits for general programming. This is because it tends to throw very useful error messages and forces clean(er) syntax. Some languages are used a lot but are clunky to for intro to programming (every-person-for-himself syntax, cryptic errors), and some languages are great for learning but don’t have a lot of practical use."

Demonstrably , though I’m sure there’s probably plenty of people who would disagree with that because I don’t simply pony up the solution. Even in Helll’s Kitchen Gordon Ramsay calls out people that are too cutthroat and don’t play well with others. Coding is a team sport and helping others is a great thing!
There’s a difference between helping and giving the answers. Gotta teach or, rather lead people to think! I do my best to help people out, given there is much I still have to learn so I often finding my self reading peoples answers and questions, and having little understanding of the concept.

562,"A Day in the Life: Alisha Grama, Codecademy Curriculum Developer","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,159,"This month, we’re featuring Alisha Grama, an associate curriculum developer at Codecademy.
Meet Alisha! 
Tell us a little about yourself.
Hey, I’m Alisha, and I’m an associate curriculum developer at Codecademy!
For a little bit about me, I moved around quite a bit as a kid, but I was born in Austin, Texas, and mostly grew up in Massachusetts. My family loves to travel, and I’ve been to over 40 countries. I love driving around, baking, reading, and listening to music. I’ve always been into building things, starting with LEGOs when I was a kid. I worked a lot with robotics and eventually found that my favorite part was the coding.
I majored in CS and minored in Ethics at the University of Rochester, a school which I primarily picked due to the cold weather (I’m a HUGE fan of snow and winter). I also appreciated their approach to learning where there were no classic gen-ed requirements, allowing students to study what they actually wanted to study.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
I was teaching in NYC, and looking to transition into EdTech, but only if I found a company and position that I was passionate about. I googled “EdTech NYC,” and Codecademy was the first result. It was the perfect intersection of coding and education for me. I applied immediately, and two months later I was here!
Did you always want to be an Associate Curriculum Developer?
I always knew that I wanted to be in education, and I knew that I loved computer science. I’d used Codecademy when I was in college, but I’d never thought I’d end up working there. It’s the kind of job that’s such a perfect fit that I never imagined it could actually exist.
What are the best aspects about working as an Associate Curriculum Developer?
While I can have days in a row that are similar, no two weeks are the exact same. There are so many steps to developing courses: researching, planning, creating initial drafts, editing, rewriting, testing, and maintaining the course once it goes live. Not to mention reviewing my teammates’ content as well. I love that there are so many tasks that I get to jump between.
What are the worst aspects about working as an Associate Curriculum Developer?
The other side of having so many tasks to jump between is that sometimes you get into a great flow and then you’re done with that task for a few weeks. Every time I’m testing a lesson it takes me the third or fourth exercise to really hit my stride, and then before I know it, I’m done and I won’t be testing my next lesson for over two weeks.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
I absolutely hate traffic, so I would be a big fan of flying cars, or a “ghost” car that can zoom through the others (I’m aware that that’s more fantasy and less sci-fi).
Do you have any advice for the learners?
It’s easy to get overwhelmed when you start, but I think a great first step is to decide what language you want to learn. Think about what you hope to eventually accomplish with your new skills, and do some research on which language would be best. Join some forums so you can talk to people who are going through the same things you are. And stick with it! Even if you can’t code every day, try to hold yourself to 3-4 days a week.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Oh, there are so many, but I think it would be fun to create a course on robotics. Maybe something to do with Thymio bots, since they’re a great “intro” robot.
What does a typical day look like for you?
There’s no one typical day, but there are some typical tasks.
I wake up around 9 and start working at 9:30. I like to use the morning as a work block and catch up on writing, testing, or reviewing. I have lunch around noon and I like to walk somewhere and pick up food (now that we’re working from home). I live in midtown Manhattan so there are so many great options around me. In the afternoon, I usually have some meetings, and then I check over bug reports from my previous courses. I spend the rest of the day (from about 2-6) working on the same tasks from the morning and reaching out to teammates about concerns/questions.
Of course, this whole routine could get completely thrown off if one task ends up taking way more time than usual. Sometimes there’s a pretty meaty review that takes up most of the day or a weird bug that I need to pair with someone to solve. I love the flexibility and variety that I get everyday!

What I mean is, I’ve enjoyed other programming courses when they tell you what the end project needs to do, but you’re on your own (or given limited instruction) on how to get there. I’m weary of the kind of approach where you’re guided through building each aspect of the project.

Thinking of going Pro General


    I’ve heard from Pro users that it is worth it. Here are what some people said: 

 










I hope this helps =)
  

I’m a pro member and I really enjoy it. I’ve heard some criticism that CodeCademy guides and babies the students, but that’s exactly what I need. I have no background at all in programming. In fact, I’m a nurse, so I have no idea what any of this is. It is like a regular classroom curriculum and I like that. I’m building a knowledge-base and slowly starting to understand things. I might not be working independently on projects in the class, but I’ve learned enough in two months that I have been able to play around with Python outside of the class. I can make a small program, run it in the terminal or upload it to Github. Two months ago I had no idea how programs were made, what to do with them, and I had never even heard of Github.
The Pro membership provides a path that has a dozen or so courses that take me anywhere between 1-2 weeks. I’ve noticed that some of the courses have “Pro” in the title, so I assume they aren’t available in the free version. Some of them are very useful to someone like me who came into this with hardly any prior knowledge.
Everyone is different, so I don’t know how other people feel about this. The most important thing I get from Codecademy is the knowledge-base. I go through each section, take notes, review and study them. The practice in the class is just a demonstration of what they’re teaching. As the course progresses, I’ve found that I’ll see something interesting and I’ll think, “I wonder what happens if I use this code with that other code I learned about.”. That’s when I start putting things together and playing around on my own.
I’m sure you can buy a few books and get the same result. I like this way much more, plus it isn’t expensive. I think it’s only like $200 for a year, right? With that I get the guidance I need, an interactive program that lets me practice on their website, and a forum to ask questions when something comes up.
The only frustration I’ve had with the program is that sometimes I wish there was more practice or more examples for a subject. Sometimes I finish the subject and don’t feel like I fully understand it. So I end up reviewing my notes a few times, doing some Googling, asking a few questions in the forum, and do a little practicing on my own. It  works out most of the time, but I can say that I’m still having problems with what I learned about SQL in the beginning of the program. I learned some commands and it had me interested, but then it just stopped. I have no idea how to get it or how to practice it more. So I’ve been trying to figure it out for the past two months. That’s just an example and that’s the only one that I don’t feel adequate with.
Overall, I say it’s definitely worth it. If you’re like me and starting from nothing, you’ll be surprised when you start making your own code within the next month.I am thoroughly enjoying all that pro has to offer so I would say yes ;).I agree with the nurse person about SQL… and more examples would be nice. But overall if you have time to do it, codecademy is fun and good for absolute beginners.I’m also interested in buying pro membership. Does it give access to every course on the website ?Yes, it does. Although some require other courses to be finished first.The pro plan has much more to offer than the free versionI do not think Code Academy is a total waste of time. However, after getting into it I realized that there are other websites like Udemy that will teach you a language, including the basics for beginners, and so much more than Code Academy for a fraction of the cost. I spent $40 on a month of Code Academy and then after getting through 35% of C# in around 3 days I realized there was not enough material. I talked to my brother who is in Computer Science and he told me it only scraped the surface. The C# course is 25 hours if I recall, and I have now found a C# course that is much more in depth and around 31.5 hours for only $13, and it is permanent rather than a subscription.I work already in multiple code languagues, what i can tell you about Codecademy pro is that it offers the very best tutorials on the basics of a subject, no question there
Even if i have experienced various stuff about codes troughout my years, the material presented on the site is outstanding! I normally buy one month to get all I need to learn from 1-3 languagues then return 0.5-1 years later or whenever i need to learn new onesThe separation from an actual code editor makes all the difference to me. When you write code in an editor, its’ just there on your hard drive or where you saved it. That isn’t the case here on codecademy, you write then must copy it. This seemingly small detail makes all the difference to me. The lessons just lose their hooks in my memory.
Writing it then coming back to the self made file sets it in memory better. Plus I spoiled myself by using phpstorm/jetbrains ide’s, you screw up you know it the moment you do it and exactly where with references to correct syntax.I agree "

VS Code has a great balance of core usefulness and customization. It does what I need it to for my basic editing needs; its built support for web coding is second to none. At the same time, I can customize it to be just the way I like it with extensions, themes, and UI tweaks.

–Josh, Senior Software Engineer

I use VS Code for all of the Rails and React work that I do on the Growth team
it’s faster than atom when it comes to file search, and has good integrations for typescript, jest, cypress, with a built-in debugger. SublimeText is the fastest, but it’s not as user friendly as atom or VS Code.

–Prith, Software Engineer

One of my absolute favorite shortcuts is ⌘L which creates cursors selecting all instances of your currently selected text throughout a file. This makes it super easy to make changes en mass throughout your code.

–Mariel, Senior Curriculum Developer

There are a few things about it that won me over about VS Code…
First, I’m primarily a Javascript developer, and the built-in rich JS support with autocomplete made my life much easier right away.
Second, VS Code’s developer-friendly architecture, open-source ethos, and strong community support ensure there’s always a quality plugin for whatever language / technology I need to work with. In the past I’d have to spend a ton of time configuring or debugging hacky plugins even for pretty standard development tasks. With VS Code, 95% of plugins I need have just worked out of the box with no further effort so I can spend more time writing code.
Lastly, it’s free. For all its advantages, you can just download it and use it without having to worry about subscription fees or buying the new version in a year. There are probably better paid specialty editors for certain languages like Java or Kotlin, but VSCode is pretty hard to beat overall.

–Casey, Senior Software Engineer

VSCode is my preferred code editor because of its wide variety of useful extensions including linting, indentation, and live server. I particularly love its built-in version control abilities with Git.

–Galina, Curriculum Developer

I prefer editors that are lightweight and don’t include a lot of stuff I don’t need. I enjoy finding and learning about new plugins that I can install to make my job easier. VSCode comes with a little more pre-installed than say Atom or Sublime Text, but the stuff it comes with like Intellisense is really useful, especially for frontend developers.

–Jake Hiller, Staff Software Engineer
What advice do you have for someone just setting up VS Code?

Enjoy the “Intellisense” features: they’ll help you code more efficiently and quickly! VS Code can correct your typos, automate basics such as file imports, and even generate basic code templates for you. Don’t be scared of the editor being smart about suggesting code for you.

–Josh, Senior Software Engineer

For someone setting up VS Code, I recommend setting up the keyboard shortcut to split/clone the current file pane to up/right/down/left. It’s useful to not have to switch between file tabs.

–Prith, Software Engineer

Spend some time upfront learning the various commands, code navigation and keyboard shortcuts; this will pay large dividends in terms of your workflow efficiency and frustration level down the line. Also, learn about splitting the screen to work with files side-by-side.
Decide which language you’re going to code in most, and research some of its popular plugins. Get set up with, at minimum, some linting and formatting capabilities for that language. This will help you learn to write more readable code with fewer bugs.
Don’t worry about getting everything set up perfectly at the start. There are a ton of configuration options and it’s not important to know what they all do. The more you use VS Code and interact with other developers, the more you’ll form your own editor preferences and discover additional plugins to help with pain points.

–Casey, Senior Software Engineer

Don’t start by trying to add a bunch of plugins, the editor will actually tell you when there is a language plugin you could use for a certain file type, so start by installing those. Once you know your way around, start digging into the plugins you might want for whatever you’re doing.
Learn the basic keyboard commands, if you type cmd+t  you can type out a few characters of a file name and navigate to it really quickly. shift+cmd+f puts you in the global search for the project you’re in, which you’ll end up using constantly.
Once you’re familiar with VSCode, look through the user preferences, there are probably a few options you’ll find in there that you’ll want to tweak. One of the ones I always change is setting  Auto Save to onFocusChange, so whenever I switch applications my files automatically save. If you always forget to save before you check your work in the browser you might want to turn that on.

–Jake, Staff Software Engineer
What are your favorite VS Code extensions and plugins?

The built-in debugger is a fantastic tool for debugging command-line apps, such as Node.js programs and unit tests. It works really well once you understand how to set it up and is an invaluable day-to-day tool for me. Live Share is really nifty too. You can share a VS Code session with someone and it works super fluidly to let you both look at and edit code at the same time.

–Josh Goldberg, Senior Frontend Developer

My favorite extension is: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer where it makes it so easy to create a server that hot reloads (reloads the web page when I make a change to my code) it’s saved me a ton of time and the hassle of having to refresh a page each time.

–Kenny, Senior Curriculum Developer

Everything outside the main editor functionality is a plugin, and VS Code ships with a number of really useful ones. They included Git, Typescript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS plugins are amazing. Besides those, I’d have to say the VIM plugin and the Settings Sync plugin are my favorites. VIM is an old-school editor that lets you do just about anything you need to with a few concise keystrokes. There’s a bit of a learning curve, but once you know it, it’s a huge time-saver. Settings sync lets you export your VS Code settings and plugins to the cloud, then import them into another instance of VS Code so you can have it set up just how you like it on any device, instantly.

–Casey, Senior Software Developer

VSCode’s built-in “IntelliSense” feature is also extremely helpful in its spell checking and code completion support for popular languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. My favorite VSCode extension has to be “Live Share” because it allows developers to co-author the same document and collaborate in real-time.

–Galina, Curriculum Developer

GitLens: If you work on a team with other engineers having easy access to the file history can be really useful.
Open in GitHub: I’m constantly using this shortcut to open files in GitHub and copy GitHub links to files to share with co-workers.
Prettier: Only really useful if your project allows it, but having automatic code formatting for JS/CSS when you save is really great.
Browser Preview:  I only use it occasionally but it can be really useful to have a browser window side-by-side with code in your editor. If you’re working on smaller projects it might be perfect for you.

–Jake, Staff Software Engineer"
567,Warning Exceptions,Random,0,108,"After getting repeated warnings of a library’s deprecated built-in functions, I decided to find a way to stop these warnings from coming as they were becoming a nuisance. I scoured forums on the web and many tutorials to come up with solution to help people who are having the same issue of wanting to ignore warnings.


About Warnings
Here is a little bit of a background of warnings, for those of you wondering: warnings are similar to errors, except they aren’t fatal to your code. Warning can be helpful for learning which lines of code to start testing when doing TDD, or knowing what could possibly be an issue during deployment of your code. Unfortunately though, for some developers warnings can be a nuisance, as they flood your IDE’s shell.



Ignoring Warnings
The following will help you ignore warnings:
from sys import warnoptions #import ""warnoptions"" from the ""sys"" module
from warnings import simplefilter #import ""simplefilter"" from the ""warnings"" module

if not warnoptions:
    simplefilter(""ignore"") #set the filter to ignore all warnings

568,There’s more to this than just writing code,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,735,"This is useful for everybody. Whether you’re doing this for fun, you want to get a job as a developer, or you want to be a freelancer. There is more to software development than just writing the code, here are a couple of things you need to consider:

Reading comprehension

As unlikely as it sounds, one of the biggest problems I’ve seen is the lack of reading comprehension. Combine this with the power of assumption and you’ll end up with a great piece of code that doesn’t do what it needs to do. Make sure you properly understand what is being asked of you before you start writing any code.

Create a flowchart

This is the first thing I was taught before I wrote my first “Hello World!” back in '99. After you understand what is being asked of you, you need to create a flow chart. This concept is more important for beginners, once you have more experience you don’t necessarily have to do this but it’s still a good idea.
Why is this important?

it reinforces your understanding of what needs to happen
if gives you a roadmap of what to do
it helps you understand what are all the possible outcomes

What are the common problems of not doing this?

you start writing code, as the code evolves you realize you missed something and now you have to change half of what you already wrote
you don’t know what all the possible outcomes are, most of the bugs found in code are related to “I didn’t think about that” or “that’s not what it’s supposed to do”

You need to account for all possibilities because the end-user will always try to do something outside of the happy path. This provides better user experience and makes it less likely for your app to crash.
Ever wonder when to add a for loop? Or maybe instead of a for loop it can be done with a switch? The flow chart will give you a good indication of what to use when.
Here is the most basic flow chart of all, which can be used for any application.
basic764×216 5.88 KB
You have an input, something happens, then you have a result. As an example, let’s use a calculator.
1725×188 4.61 KB
Simple enough, right? But what happens if I provide a letter as an input? I need to make sure it’s a number or it won’t work. So, I take the process block and break it down.
2867×307 17.3 KB
I have to make sure the input is an integer. Therefore, I need to add an if statement to my code.
You can break down every piece of a flow chart as much as you want, in the end it will tell you exactly what code you need to write. Once you have all the pieces of the puzzle, you can write all your classes, functions, constructors, what have you. The flow charts tell you how to put it together. After you put it all together, you can use it as a validation tool to make sure your program is doing everything it needs to do.
There are many tools for creating flowcharts, I used Google Drawings for these examples. I really miss using Microsoft VISIO, the first time I used it was on a laptop that was running Windows 3.11… it was very bulky, but it was my first laptop and I loved it. However, doing flow charts by hand is also very useful, I find that writing things down reinforces all the concepts being learned.
I’m very surprised that these concepts are not taught in courses, even at the college level. I’ve run into mid-level developers who have a degree in Software Engineering that could not build a flowchart for their code. I find that mind-boggling. It’s a very simple but quite powerful tool."
569,[Article] List of VS Code extensions with descriptions,Featured Challenges and Events,2,2.8k,"In this article, we’ll go through some extensions for VS Code, as well as a number of fancier ones, beyond that initial setup. You likely won’t end up using all of these, as some are better suited for certain languages and personal preferences than others, but you can always refer back to this list in the future.
Let’s get started!
Visual Studio Code (the “Code” is significant, do not confuse this with Visual Studio) is a feature-laden text editor that will allow you to write code on your own computer in a manner reminiscent of the center panel in your three-panel learning environment on Codecademy.com 4.
As you can see in this post by the VS Code team 30 and this video 30, using effective shortcuts and increasing productivity is almost always what developers mean when they talk about “using VS Code like a pro.” Which makes sense! Who doesn’t want to get through their work more quickly and efficiently? Here, we’ll review extensions that will help you maximize your productivity in VS Code.
VS Code Extensions
There are a ton of extensions available in VS Code. And you can find all of them in the Marketplace.
Developers use a combination of extensions to make their code easier to write, easier to understand, more accurate, and/or to get through writing large blocks of code more quickly.
We’ll start off here by listing the extensions we think are most helpful to Codecademy learners, regardless of which coding language you are learning… beyond the official Codecademy theme 28 that is.
The Must-Haves 

To find each of these extensions, type the name of the extension into the search bar. We’ve listed each one with its searchable name. (For reference, this section starts at 22:30 19 in the Codecademy webinar I posted about last week).
The extensions that will keep you organized


Auto Rename Tag 67: this extension helps you avoid typos or accidentally lose your place. If you change a div name, Auto Rename Tag will automatically change the other end (meaning, if you change the opening, it will automatically change the closing, or vice versa).


Auto Close Tag 37: as you might guess, it closes your brackets for you. If you’re using Emmet (more on that below) you may not need Auto Close Tag, but if you aren’t, it’s a must.


Bracket Pair Colorizer 50: this extension is most helpful for Javascript, but can be used with other languages. Bracket Pair Colorizer color-matches code and parentheses, and maintains a line between the opening and closing brackets to better keep track of where the code is and to ensure that you never get lost in bracket ■■■■. It’s really helpful in finding missing brackets.


Indent-rainbow 65: if you’re not a fan of the whitespace indicator setting mentioned above, this is the extension for you. It creates color-coded rainbow bars to help you line up your code and stay organized. This may be hard to visualize - you’ll find it at 25:16 in the Codecademy webinar.


Bookmarks 34: speaking of staying organized, this is an extremely handy extension that places small blue bookmarks in the margins of your file and adds a small panel right below your file browser which lists all active bookmarks in the current project. You can then easily switch between places in the file and/or leave reminders for yourself to go back to certain snippets of code. Super useful!


The extensions that will make it easier for others to read your code


Prettier 41: as the name implies, it makes your code look prettier by formatting it properly. Prettier code is more readable by others.  This is very important.  When you’re learning, you’re often focused on making sure the code works. In the outside world, you’re usually writing code for others, so having prettier code can give you a real edge in a job interview or in a work presentation, or when you’re collaborating with your team. During the learning process, pay close attention to what Prettier does with your code. You can learn a lot about proper formatting by following along with Prettier instead of just letting it do the work for you.


Beautify 20: Since Prettier does not work for all coding languages (the biggest one being HTML), Beautify is another good plugin to have. This guide 16 will show you how to install it and adjust your settings so that Beautify doesn’t interfere with your Prettier settings.


ESLint: A linter is a program that analyzes your code for potential programmatic and stylistic errors. It is a static analysis tool that can spot errors before you debug, and can ensure that your code adheres to a specific style guide, which is especially important when multiple people are working on code together. Linting your code will help you ensure that you’re following the formatting requirements of your project or your employer. Think of it as a kind of spelling and grammar check for your source code. It’s especially useful to lint code in interpreted programming languages, such as Javascript, Python, HTML, and CSS. There are linters for each of those languages. We highly recommend installing a linter, and suggest starting with ESLint (Javascript) 10. A quick search for programming language + lint will yield a linter for other programming languages (CSSLint, etc.).


For a visual walk through of the configuration of these extensions, check out this Wes Bos video on Prettier + ESLint in VS Code. 10
Emmet and Intellisense
Emmet 7 and Intellisense 5 are not extensions, per se, as they are both baked into VS Code. (Please review the links to each program for the VS Code user guides). We’re highlighting them here because both can be enormously helpful if you understand the key features of each one.
Emmet
Emmet abbreviations and shortcuts speed up your code writing process. It kind of looks like autocomplete for code in that it expands snippets for you. Emmet abbreviation and snippet expansions are enabled by default in  html ,  haml ,  jade ,  slim ,  jsx ,  xml ,  xsl ,  css ,  scss ,  sass ,  less  and  stylus  files, as well as any language that inherits from any of the above like  handlebars  and  php . We highly recommend reviewing the VS Code section of this site 14 for more info on and visuals of configuring Emmet.
For example, Emmet is especially helpful when you’re doing front end work, and can save you a lot of time with its shortcuts to boilerplate language. The screenshot below has an example of Emmet’s shortcut to boilerplate on HTML websites. (P.S. you can also use this HTML Boilerplate 6 extension).
 66
As you can see from the screenshot, the Emmet section of the Codecademy webinar starts around 28:10 8. Since this may be easier to understand if you can see it, we do suggest checking out this part of the webinar (especially the bit about multicursor functions at the end).
For a little more on Emmet for HTML and CSS, check out this quick run through. 3 If you find yourself in need of a cheat sheet to Emmet documentation, you can find one here 3.
Intellisense
Intellisense is a code completion tool. It automatically supports JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Less, and Sass. When you start typing a code item, VS Code will offer suggestions that you can use. Intellisense covers a few languages out of the box(Javascript, Typescript, HTML, JSON, CSS, Lisp, and SAS) but if you are using one that isn’t covered (like Python) you can search for “Python” in the extension marketplace and find the extension for Python that helps with Intellisense. Intellisense can show you what may be coming next in your code, and can autocomplete variables you make on the same page. See the screenshot below, from the 35:00 mark 1 in the webinar:
 5
As with Prettier, above, use Intellisense wisely. Pay attention to what it suggests and why, and how often you select certain options. It’s a great tool, but don’t overly rely on it at the expense of your learning.
A special thank you to Codecademy Product Manager, @oduffy, for compiling these resources and drafting this article!Auto Rename and Bracket Pair Colorizer are two I wish I’d known about before, these are going to save me so much grief! Thanks for this helpful resource.I want to add the following extensions to the above list:

Your post belongs in the Community section 5.
There really should be no reason your text is that small.  Try using a different browser, or looking in your browser’s settings for something that might override default font size.i tried chrome, firefox, even explorer… it happens in ANY area where you write code, it also happens in tumblr.@mariagreg I can zoom in on the Codecademy interface in Firefox. In your screenshot, it doesn’t look like anything, even the instructions, is zoomed in. If you press Ctrl + in the interface, does it not change?I’m trying to think of what could be wrong, something in your computer settings, a plug-in, I have no clue what the matter is. I do however have an idea that could make the text bigger so you can read it.
This probably isn’t really a “fix”, but it’s the first idea I got that should change the size of your text. It’s might look complicated, but it’s easier than it looks. 
Right-click on the text area, click “Inspect Element”. A white box filled with loads of code will come on your screen, but don’t worry, you won’t need to do much. In the top of the white box, 5th from the left, there should be a button that looks like { } … that’s the Stylesheet Editor.
Find the box filled with code, scroll down a little until you find this
@keyframes spinner {
from {
-webkit-transform:rotate(0deg);
transform:rotate(0deg)
}
to {
-webkit-transform:rotate(360deg);
transform:rotate(360deg)
}
}
Under it paste this bit of code

{
font-size: 16px;
}

That code should make the font size of ALL text to a normal reading size. You can close the Inspector and continue. If it’s just this page that does this to you, then you should be fine for all the future lessons, if all the lessons do this, then you can do this for every page. Unfortunately that will be annoying, so keep trying to figure out what the problem is.
Good luck! Bumping for people who just switched to Ubuntu/linux."

Post in Get Help
Hello
I’m working on “ Tourist Attractions ” project in “ Build Python Web Apps with Flask ” and I got stuck at some steps and wasn’t able to complete due to lack of instructions. Can you check all the instructions of this project?
Can’t find tags mentioned in instructions in location.html
Step 5

Inside the <tbody class=""loctable""> tags create a for loop that surrounds the <tr> tags
Inside the <td class=""loc""> tags insert the name attribute of the location object
Inside the <td class=""desc""> tags insert the description attribute of the location object

Step 7

Inside the <td class=""btns""> tags create an if statement that surrounds the <form> tags

Step 14

Inside the <form class=""addform"" tag set the action attribute to url_for() that takes the add_location route function as an argument

Can’t find the statement mentioned in instructions in app.py
Step 9

Inside the locations() route function replace the False condition of the if statement with a check that the request object’s method attribute equals POST


Step 10

Replace the [(None, None)] statement with the output of the items() method of the request objects form attribute
Hi,
Thanks for bringing this up! This has been reported recently and hopefully they’ll patch it up soon. It’s still a new module so it’s going to have a few rough patches.
If you’re interested in more resources for learning flask, I recommend Miguel Grinberg’s blog (and his O’Reilley edition book, it really is a must-own), Corey Schaffer’s youtube channel, and the flask subreddit has a lot of helfpul knowledeable users on it.Thank you for letting me know that."

584,Help with the next steps after learning on Codecadamy?!,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",4,237,"Hi I am not sure if I have posted this in the right place. I have finished a good chunk of the web development course and I still have a long way to go but I can build a basic html and css website. I want to carry on making some mock websites for fictional companies etc as practise and my husband would like me to re design his website which he currently pays for via vistaprint. Is the best way to do this from scratch or on something like wordpress which is something else I am hoping to learn.
I just wonder what the next steps are!
ThnaksHello there,
There isn’t a clear cut path to follow, per say.
It depends on what you want to learn, and achieve.
Re-building your husband’s website is a great start. And, yes, using WordPress is one way to go about this. Knowledge of this particular platform is in high demand, though a bit saturated, and it’d definitely be a great way of expanding your skillset.
If you go this route, simply try figuring out how to make a WordPress theme from scratch. You’ll learn a great deal that way. And it’ll look nice on your resume should you wish to use it to demonstrate your skills to employers.
One thing you might be interested in, though, is JavaScript. HTML and CSS are great for basic, static websites, but JavaScript enables you to add an extra layer of interactivity to your project.
You can learn it here: Introduction to JavaScript 1
Once you’ve grasped the core concepts of JS, you can then move on to use a framework, such as Vue.js, React.js 1, or even just the jQuery library for simpler tweaks.
You might want to do the same for CSS, which has frameworks such as Bulma.io, or Twitter’s Bootstrap. They can help you speed up the development process.
Hope this helps, and feel free to ask should you have any more questions!Thank you very much for your reply!
Javascript is definitely my next goal to achieve but I know it will take me a bit longer I struggled a little bit with the basics but I will keep practising!
I read online about how popular wordpress is and one website said how it can be better than building a site from scratch, is there pros and cons from building from scratch vs building it on wordpress?A big pro is development time.
Imagine building a house. WordPress represents the foundations, which would take you a long time and some crucial expertise to put together. With WordPress, you can simply decorate your house.
Only downsides would be:

Being limited to the WordPress “framework” (more like way of doing things)
Not learning everything by yourself (which would improve your knowledge and skills)

I’ve built entire websites from scratch, my own CMS (Content Management System) and let me tell you: it’s hard work. Takes time, and you don’t always get everything right straight away. It’s great for learning purposes, but nowadays people learn frameworks and use CMSs such as WordPress’s instead. Most devs use them, and employers look for people with knowledge of those frameworks and platforms.
So yes, I’d advise using WordPress, or learn a framework such as Laravel (PHP), Django (Python), Rails (Ruby). You’ll increase the odds of finding a job (should you wish to do that).That’s brilliant info thank you, I will add wordpress onto my to-do list!
Then once I’ve got on a bit more I can venture into some of the others!"
585,How do You Cope?,Community,9,209,"I’m not even certain this is how to approach this, but do you people find this difficult: the learning? Every time I visit the academy, i go away feeling stupid(er) and hopeless. Nothing gets through to me! So, please, how do you cope with this kind of frustrations?Hey there! I get how feel, I’ve been through it. I recently wrote an article on Dealing with Frustration While Learning to Code 8, so you can check that out if you want 
Also I just want to tell you, please do not give up. Coding can be really hard at times but the key is persistence. And if ever need help with anything, you can always come here to the forums and ask for help 
Hope this helped you! Hey! I’m so very thankful you took time to reply! And yes this helped. A lot.So glad it did Hi, I’ve been getting back into coding.
I’m a professional musician. I still remember what it was like to begin as a beginner. Let me tell you, that feeling of not knowing everything, or that things aren’t clicking perfectly doesn’t really go away.
What can go away is the anxiety that it’s a bad thing! New things take time to click even when you’ve been in a field for a long time. Being kind to yourself and giving yourself the time you need to fully digest information is the best advice I can recommend (along with sticking to it!).We all have different learning styles and preferences. Some times it’s not about how smart you are, but the way it was explained to you. I’m sure you’ve heard of how some people are more “visual learners” while others are more “auditory learners”. Some prefer to write it down on paper long hand, while others swear by voice notes.
My point is, you might want to take a moment to think about the best way you like to learn. The ways ideas stick better to you. Coding, especially at beginner levels, is something anyone can learn. Stay motivated, ask the community when you have questions, and have patience.
In my case, I like learning by doing, so every time I cover something new I like to step aside and do a mini-project using the concepts I just learned!Learning to code is frustrating. We’ve all been there (and if people tell you they haven’t felt frustrated, they’re lying).
Give yourself a break, cut yourself some slack. You’re not going to learn everything; no one can.
It’s easy to get overwhelmed when learning a new language…b/c that’s what you’re doing (I tell myself, ‘would I expect to learn how to read and write [insert foreign language here]’? Nope!). For me, repetition helps. Doing helps. Write the code in the lessons, erase your answers, do it again. Maybe take notes, draw diagrams and write technical concepts in words that make sense to you, using your lexicon.  Also, a key part of learning these new concepts and languages is if you can explain what you’re doing to someone else that will further solidify concepts in your brain too.
It’s a weird mindset to some…getting comfortable being uncomfortable. BUT, you become less and less uncomfortable the more you do/practice and the kinder you are to yourself. Keep going but also know when to take a break and come back.
That’s just my .02Haha☺the sticking to it part is already proving hard. But I’ll take your word for it. Thank you so much for replying to me. It is encouraging that others too went through the same, or almost similar situation.Hey! Thank you so much for this. I suppose, giving myself some time won’t hurt.Hey! Wow, this is different. Getting comfortable being uncomfortable. I should really try this. Thank you so much for your insights."

I’ve also used Notepad++ and Sublime. They’re fine too. But I don’t really use a code editor any more. I use Jupyter Notebook or Colab for Python.VSCode here, with the Atom keymap extension (because I used to use Atom) and the SynthWave 84 theme. 
It also talks directly to WSL, which is proving much more straightforward than having a VM…Atom has proven to be a nice middle ground and fairly platform independent though I’d probably still drift to PyCharm whenever I encounter bigger projects.I was going to put that I mainly program in punch card but since that option is not there I had to settle for sublime.

587,International Pi Aproximentation Day,Random,2,106,"Howdy Folks!! 

To share a fun fact and holiday with you:

The twenty-second of July, which has the date 22-7, is also know as Pi Aproximentation Day!
For those of you who didn’t know this, this is due to the fact that 22 divided by 7 is aproximently 3.142
>>> a = 22 / 7
>>> print(a)
3.142857142857143

Which is in turn an aproximation of Pi, the number representing the ratio of a circles diameter to its circumference. It is represented with the lowercase roman letter π that shares the same name.
It has been used in various ways since the time of the Egyptions whom required it for construction projects and has been built on since then.
Being important to math lovers, number crunchers, construction workers, scientists, and many others, you just gotta love the usefulness of it.
Being used in almost every formula involving circles and spheres, its uses range from calculating the floor space your round carpet occupies all the way up to Einstein’s field equation for general relativity.
Here’s a list of ways π is used.

Let’s give it up for π today, it certainly deserves it!
Thanks for reading and I hope everyone has a great rest of the day I think I will approximate some pie for dessert today in honor of 22/7  
There is certainly that too!"

can I use google images on sites (ie google pictures of food for a food shop site) or do I need to use my own?  do I need to state where images are from?
can I look at a website online and try to recreate it without using any of their code? this also applies to some of the examples that I have worked through in the courses.  how much of it is mine? do I need to say where I got the idea from?

                Absolutely. Make mock websites for fictional businesses. No need to state it, IMO. 


No, I wouldn’t do that, as some may be subject to copyright. I’d use free, stock images from websites that allow you to use these images as you please. Better be safe. 


Yup, that’s actually very good practice. …

Yup, that’s actually very good practice. In this case, make sure to mention that this is a copy of website X with the sole purpose of being made for learning purposes. Never blatantly copy and pretend it’s an original idea. That said, nothing stops you from getting inspiration from website X, another from website Y, and Z. Just don’t copy a whole layout and claim it your own.

593,Let’s talk about Number,Corner Bar,19,304,"Anyone who has been around Maths for awhile will have come across some numbers that have special properties. 42 is one of those numbers, but I’ve long ago forgotten how it is so. Anyone who can fill us in is welcome to have a go.
If you know of some special numbers, add them so this topic.
Today I learned about Narcissistic Numbers which are composed of digits that when raised to the power of the number of digits, and then added together will arrive at the same number. The example given was 8208. Being a curious sort, I had to test that…
>>> from math import log10, floor
>>> x = 8208
>>> n = floor(log10(x)) + 1
>>> y = 0
>>> while x > 0:
	y += (x % 10) ** n
	x //= 10

	
>>> y
8208
>>> 

Looking forward to any interesting numbers you’ve come across to let’s keep this topic growing!

One suspects this is not going to light many fires, but my own faith says it will start one or two. Now that we know the four digit number that fits this scenario we are left with the question of whether there are two and three digit numbers that act the same. Extending beyond four digit numbers will follow, as curiosity goes.
Apparently there are 88 such known numbers that satisfy this construct. The good news is that they are all less than, 10^39.One has always held that exponent laws (including log) and calculus should be introduced in Grade 7. Right at the beginning of junior high maths. What an eye opener it would be at a crucial time in the learning curve. From there on the expectations would be from the learners, not the teachers.Here 1 is the Wiki page on 42, and it has some very interesting elements. I think 42, in old programming, was the number representing *, which (as some of you may know), means everything.Proof of concept…
from math import log10, floor
def nn(n):
    a = 10 ** (n - 1) + 1
    b = 10 ** n
    print (a, b)

        y = 0
        while x > 0:
            y += (x % 10) ** n
            x //= 10
        if i == y: print (i, y)

The last one (n==7) took about 10 seconds. One expects it will take a long time to get to n==39. Something for a super computer to chew through. We’ve found the first 15 of 88.One speedup I can see is to store the results of (0…9) ** n in a dictionary that way we only have to calculate once and lookup these values instead of doing a calculation for every digit of every num in the range.
We will still hit a wall pretty quickly and might not even get n=8 in a reasonable time still but it will help.
Something like
from math import log10, floor
def nn(n):
    a = 10 ** (n - 1) + 1
    b = 10 ** n
    nums = range(10)
    exponents = {x:x**n for x in nums}
    print (a, b)
    for i in range(a, b):
        x = i
        y = 0
        while x > 0:
            y += exponents[x % 10]
            x //= 10
        #print ((i, y), end="", "")
        if i == y: print (i, y)
took about two minutes to get n(8) with the updated code
10000001 100000000

24678050 24678050

24678051 24678051

88593477 88593477
It took about half the time to do nn(7).
from math import log10, floor

def nn(n):
    a = 10 ** (n - 1) + 1
    b = 10 ** n
    print (a, b)
    d = {x: x ** n for x in range(10)}
    for i in range(a, b):
        x = i
        y = 0
        while x > 0:
            y += d[x % 10]
            x //= 10
        if i == y: print (i, y)

Edit.
The calculation mode took 32 seconds to do nn(7). The dictionary mode took 12 seconds. That’s a substantial improvement. Thanks @fight_dragons  for chipping in.
My system is a 2013 A10 with 16 GB Ram. Python 3.8

Edit
My machine is obviously not as fast as today’s machines. The 8 digit call took 5 and a half minutes to complete.
When thinking how this could be done with binary, given that bitwise operators are 32 bit (still?) we would have to interleave each order of magnitude to handle the larger numbers. We couldn’t get all the way to 10^39, but close. Our limit would be 128 bits. That gives us four interleaves. We could then go through all the permutations. Still, a tonne of work but I’m betting it would be the fastest.I’ve made another improvement.
Consider the numbers 135,153,315,351,513,531 - they all have the same sum
If we could filter out all these combination numbers we could reduce the amount of calculations we need to do enormously. For example when n=2 we only have 45 numbers to check instead of 90
when n = 7 we go from 9000000 sums to calculate to just 11440 sums to calculate
That’s all a bit math-y and I have not done a great job explaining but heres the code
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement


def nn(n):
    a = 10 ** (n - 1) + 1
    b = 10 ** n
    print(a, b)

    nums = [x for x in range(10)]
    d = {x: x ** n for x in range(10)}
    nums_to_check = list(combinations_with_replacement(nums, n))
    nums_to_check = [int(''.join(map(str, idx))) for idx in nums_to_check]
    z = [sum(map(lambda x: d[int(x)], str(x))) for x in nums_to_check]
    for num in z:
        if num in range(a, b) and sum(map(lambda x: d[int(x)], str(num))) == num:
            print(num)

It’s as messy as the explanation but it ran nn(7) in a tenth of a second nn(13) takes about 5 seconds
My machine is a 2012 mbp with 4gb ram python 3.8
I’m excited to see your results!Holy cow! So my notion of working with permutations had some validity. Going to give your code a run and see what happens (just so).
We could see some symmetry just in the early outputs. You’ve made that perfectly clear. Brilliant work.
Edit
Yeah, nn(13) took about 5 seconds. So we should be able to do nn(14) in about a minute. Off to try…

I cleaned up the code some more, there were some type conversions where there didn’t need to be so I got a negligible amount of speed out of it. Thanks for making this post, you definitely got at least one fire going. I had a lot of fun digging deep into some numbers and watching the code evolve.

Hey, I’m glad you enjoy this topic and have taken a dive into it. Fear of Maths keeps so many learners from taking a deep dive into the study of Number (which they mistakenly equate to Maths). Given that math is something that comes so naturally, the fear of it is like being afraid of the dark. An irrational fear (no pun intended), to be sure.
I’m terrible at math once it starts getting overly esoteric, but it is still interesting and I at least can tell when I’m in over my head. Wouldn’t be able to tell that if I didn’t at least jump in.

For timing I used the datetime.datetime.timestamp() method.
    from datetime import datetime as dt
    ...
    ta = dt.timestamp()
    ...
    tz = dt.timestamp()
    print (tz - ta)

Aside
One question I have,
if num in range(a, b) ...

Is there any chance that num will not be in the range?yes, at n = 3 our range is 101 - 1000 consider 999 its sum 9^3 + 9^3 + 9^3 = 2187
or  111 - 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3  = 3
Now the choice is between the range check or computing 2^3 + 1^3 + 8^3 + 7^3 which we know will always be false anyway. I’m assuming that the range check will be faster so it went on the left hand of the ‘and’ statement so we can short circuit the out of ranges.
I think this could be worked around - however
 nums_to_check = list(combinations_with_replacement(nums, n))
This line does the heavy lifting of getting the unique integer digit sets(just 135, not its permutations ) for us. Sadly it does it for the range 0-b not a-b. We could reinvent the wheel in a big way to save some time. Let’s measure how much time
The list size of the integer digit sets ‘nums_to_check’ is ( n+9 choose 9)
At n = 3 there are (12 choose 9) = 220 sets
At n = 2 there are (11 choose 9) =  55 of these sets
As it stands we are overpopulating our list and doing the extra bounds check on 55 extra sets.
Luckily we know that n=39 is our highest possible n (theres math to prove this as well lol)
at n= 39 there are 1677106640 sets
at n= 38 there are 1362649145 sets
Only need 314,457,495 while we use 1677106640 sets
About 5.33 times the work we need to do.
That’s the last big bottle neck I see here. If we could reduce the size of nums_to_check we could save a lot of those conditional checks later.Yeah, now you mention, it should have been obvious.



 fight_dragons:

nums_to_check = list(combinations_with_replacement(nums, n))


I got a slight boost in speed by leaving it as the iterator and letting the list comprehension cover the conversion.
nums_to_check = combinations_with_replacement(nums, n)

Good catch - that cast isn’t necessary.Had to take a second look when you wrote, (n + 9)C9. But just to see for myself,

Told ya I did some digging haha. You owe me if you ever win any bar bets with that one.I’ve forgotten all the little tricks that used to get my glass refilled. 1089 comes to mind, that one paid off a lot. The cube of a 3-digit number was impressive but I’ve long ago forgotten the mental algorithm for that one.
Given only 3 seconds can you multiply any three digit number by 7, 11 and 13? (Don’t give it away if you can.)
This topic is about Number in all its fashion and quirkiness. Let’s keep it going.Owing that our combination object is consumed, we can give it its own variable. The result is now the sample size we’re working with from here on out.
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

    a, b = 10 ** (n - 1) + 1, 10 ** n

This issue has also been mentioned here:




FAQ: Data Types - Putting it All Together General Coding FAQ


    so im guessing you cant square 1 you have to try other numbers
  


image1920×937 96 KBSo if we inspect the element of sketch.js we find these lines
      if(myNumber == true) throw ""\nnot number""
      if(myNumber == false) throw ""\nnot number""

which I think represent the problem you’re talking about (1 or 0, since 1 and 0 evaluate as true and false respectively)
let test = true;
console.log(test==1);
// true

See the code below:

  if (programChoice == 'square'){
    try {
      if(myNumber == """") throw ""\nnot number"";
      if(isNaN(myNumber)) throw ""\nnot number"";
      if(myNumber !== Number(myNumber)) throw ""\nnot number"";
      if(myNumber == true) throw ""\nnot number""
      if(myNumber == false) throw ""\nnot number""


function squareNumber(number){
  return (number*number)
}
Ah, yes, that must be it. Should I be taking down this topic then?No this is perfect, they should fix it. I don’t work for them As soon as I saw the problem only affected 1 and 0 and was JS based, I thought it was likely a truthy/falsey test failure.

Final test will never pass if your you have a space after your @switch statement.
I discovered the issue after giving up and viewing the solution.  I then ran the solution code and my code through a diff tool.  The single space was the only difference that made it pass when I changed my code to match the solution code.
I was able to reset my code and reproduce this more than once to confirm.
The tests fail if your code looks like this:
@switch (grade)

but pass if your code looks like this
@switch(grade)

The error message presented is not helpful/relevant.  Additionally, the formatting in the example portion of the the lesson uses a space here, so the error is counter intuitive.  This is a minor error but led to quite a bit of frustration.  The single whitespace in question has no syntatic significance whatsoever in C#.

(Greetings from Argentina  )For the price of a couple of books you can buy a Premium membership at SitePoint that lasts a year (some offers are lifetime) and then go to town on the free ebooks.Buenas compatriota!
@mtf suggestion is good, I also use scribd to find a lot of downloadable ebooks (it’s a payed subscription service as well).

598,Option to copy-paste text from examples,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,5,156,"Should be a huge time-saver.
For learning, it is not important to retype exact text when needed.
It would much improve my UX if I could just CLICK (or some mouseover-hint-then-click)
on the text and have it in clipboard, so I can paste it in solution.
I’m talking about VALUES not code. Just VALUES.
image714×600 16 KBI can’t use double-click as sometimes it is more than one word,
and selecting text as now can be tiresome and “tricky” (specially on tablet).Hi! Welcome to the forums 
Given the nature of programming: it might be arguable that it is important to be precise in typing exact text (or rather, knowing when it is important, and when it is not). Yes, I copy and paste all the time in my projects, but I also have to know the pitfalls (for example in python, I have to double-check all my copy and paste sections for indentation errors, or for improperly formatted quotation marks).
I don’t think CC is set up to run particularly well on tablets. But then again, I don’t know any app that beats out a text editor in a laptop/desktop scenario (this may change in the near future). For learning on a tablet, I usually just read e-books or put on youtube videos and have a laptop on the side to test out whatever is necessary.Thanks for a nice comment. I agree that copy-paste is not a way to code.
Problem is CodeCademy system uses EXACT text values to test if a challenge is properly solved, so variable names and variable values MUST be exactly the same as specified. This is why copy-paste values would be such time-saver only on CodeCademy
I agree that CC tablet experience is not something of importance, but I guessed that someone somewhere is using it in that way. Of course that using Emacs or VIM (or even beginners VSCode or ST3) is much pleasant experience on desktop.It seems to me that mobile is quite important to CC 
image737×797 82.8 KBYeaaa haha. Not for me… I do think about the best ways to train when I’m commuting. Though honestly I just take audio notes of whatever I’m studying and that seems to help more. Or listen to a tech podcast. Reading an ebook I guess is an option but I do worry about eye sight for prolonged periods of reading such tiny text.
I guess they’re trying to do a duolingo type thing. Could be interesting."

I have my own blog on Wordpress already, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to combine this with a portfolio. Wat do you think?What is the purpose of the portfolio? If your end goal is to get a job at a company, you don’t need one unless you’re a UI\UX designer. If you’re looking to be a developer, potential employers will want to look at your code, not how it looks. In this case, a public repository is your portfolio.
If you want to be a freelancer, then you do want to show off your work but depending on what you’ve done you need permission from your client to showcase the app. Even if you have permission, most apps require an account. A potential employer will not create accounts and fully use your app.
Built on Wordpress, use a Wordpress theme or build it from scratch? You only want to build things from scratch if you’re a UI\UX designer, developers don’t deal with that, you just apply CSS given to you by designers."

I feel odd if I can’t do codecademy at this time and try to reorganise time with friends/family around it if possible, also I am super relaxed if I have a special reason to break my streak - always nice to have a treat! I usually never get more than a 9/10 day streak but then i come back to it the next day. No point sweating over something as flexible as this!Ah, I love the measured approach! Sounds like you’re setting yourself up for a sustainable habit. Keep checking in with us; love hearing how this is going for everyone.You should keep the habit by trying to code every day, and at the same time. The best time, in my opinion, is 1pm to 2pm.I definitely tend to do the lessons later, at 9-10 pm.I dont know if its the quarantine or an actual habbit but I practice everyday, I feel like I need to do it or I feel something is missing in my day. Havent missed a day since april 4thCongrats! That is my goal as well!

I’am really good at creating a habit since a believe in the power of micro habit and I really know that in order to create a habit you should definitely set your own time and your own standard. For me is working about 2 hours with CodeAcademy and then switching during the day’s reading or watching different articles. My challenge is something else, I really enjoy learning how to code but in the end I don’t know if I have going to have a strong passion about coding, like riding a bicycle. Usually when I learn something new I kind of develop the habit during the way. I hope this coding journey goes well for me and for you as well. "

602,What was your win this week?,Random,7,190,"So, what was YOUR win for this past week? It can be coding related or not.

Did you finish a project?
Did you learn something new & apply it to a new project?
Did you help someone else?

Tell us! Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! I have a 34 day coding streak. (hooray! No, seriously, this is the longest I’ve gone outside of work).
Not sure if this counts, but, I cooked a nice meal for myself. I haven’t been cooking much–more like assembling food-- so, it was nice to get back into the kitchen and make up a recipe. Nothing fancy, but, better than delivery.  After about a month of practice with C++ and Arduino programing, I finally got my first build done that was entirely on my own.
All it is is 4 led lights that you turn on and off by pushing a button, or you can push another button and they do a quick lttle light show, but hey when I got everything working right it was a win in my book.
And it opens the door to making more useful devices. I’m considering a custom mouse.That’s a nice long streak, I’d imagine you’re seeing some definite changes in your own skillset after all that  . Good job on getting your control program running and you should definitely be proud of that one; I think interfacing with certain devices is a skill all of its own (here’s looking at you printers* of the world) and best of luck with your next project.
Nothing overly exciting in the kitchen for me this week bar having fresh coriander for the first time in like a year or so which means it’s going into everything . I think I’m just coming up on two weeks where I’ve been practicing ‘proper’ touch typing which is a good sign I’ll be continuing with it. I think I’ve spent enough time around a keyboard to type without looking at it but the difference I’m finding after practicing the ‘proper’ finger positions is night and day. Coding-wise I’ve shifted a few personal file management and organisation scripts that used to be in Python into command line versions after having just finished that course which felt like a nice way to wrap up learning that one.
* I’ll grant that’s not really the same but I couldn’t resist bashing printers.My win is that I’ve settled on a nice studying rhythm, and I’m seeing some nice results. I’m using Beginning JavaScript (McPeak/Wilton) in the mornings and Learning PHP, MySQL, and Javascript (Nixon) in the evenings, and things feel like they’re coming together. I started the Technical Interview course here at CodeCademy, and have been pleased that my knowledge of classes and objects is (barely) up to it–so far, at least!I have made 71 days Steak . I’m trying my best to complete Data Science Path and then start with R. I will be leaving the Projects for now but i will surely complete them.
You can say Codecademy has become a part of my Life. I can’t imagine where will i would have been if i didn’t knew about Codecademy  and here I’m blessed to get along people like you .71 Days?!? That’s great!

Also I would like to get inputs from fellow community members.
Thanks.Thankyou soo much for Creating and always doing soo much for us Codecademythanks a lot but i would really enjoy a project that uses swift. thanksYou can probably adapt some of these to swift. (just a thought!)
Most of these projects didn’t have to do with things I needed so I did my own to get by.
It would be great if they had swift ones though…Alrighty then,  once I become more acquainted with the language I will try to do them my own way using Swift. Thanks. I’m pretty new to this stuff.Hello people! I just completed my first challenge project - World population in SQL.
Is it really that useful to share these projects on my resume to get a job?? Please answer.
Also I am having trouble understanding how to share this project. Please help me, I am new to this.You could upload your queries in one file and your presentation powerpoint in another on your Github account.

604,Any good books that you can recommend specific to a topic/language or in general?,Random,5,188,"This question was asked in a webcast that was just hosted by @peachesmotorsports! We can share that recording here momentarily, but I thought we could ask this question to you all!
What are your favorite books to supplement your coding learning practice?I have several books from No Starch 1, all of which I’ve found to be quite good. I also have a Packt book, for Android programming with Kotlin which seems alright (what of it I’ve got through so far anyway).From the coding perspective, I don’t have a lot of books. Most of what I’ve learned is through courses like the ones from Codecademy or just random tutorials found online. From my perspective, the Codecademy courses are enough to get you started. Once you get started, you just have to keep going.
Courses I’ve taken (not all from Codecademy):
C++
Assembly
Ladder
C#
Ruby
Black Box Testing
JAVA
Javascript
SQL
Mongo
Command Line
Building APIs from scratch
Python
This does not mean that I have mastered all those languages, it means I’m proficient and that at some point I had to use that language to complete a project for school or work. I learned what I needed, I used it and it served its purpose, I moved on. This is why I keep saying that you need to be flexible, as an example Javascript will never be a substitute for Assembly or Ladder. Each application has a language that is better suited for it.
Here are the few books I have and have found useful for my career:


How to win friends & influence people, Dale Carnegie -> this book was useful when transitioning to a leader\management role, it was recommended by a friend who is a manager


The Selenium Guidebook, Dave Haffner -> I failed many times at software automation, this book taught me what I needed to succeed


Cucumber & Cheese - A tester’s workshop, Jeff Morgan -> taught me why my initial implementation of Cucumber failed and how to do it properly


The other books I have are related to DevOps which are out of scope for this community.I’m not sure someone else here will find this useful, but I’ll say it anyways lol.
The first coding language I learned was Python, when I was around 11 years old. So…I used the Coding Club Python books and a Python For Children book. They are honestly so fun; they made me fall in love with coding. (And let’s be honest who doesn’t love creating some cool games?). The satisfaction sensation each time I completed a project was so amazing, and it just really encouraged me to keep going.Some of my favorites:

The C Programming Language
Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites
Think ___ Series
Beginning Javascript (McPeak/Wilton) and Learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript (Nixon) are thick, textbook type books that I’m finding extremely helpful. They supply so much more detail and practice actually coding in my own editor. However, doing the courses here first was valuable to get me started."

Estimated Career Path Completion Times 21
Career Path completion times vary greatly from learner to learner. The numbers below are estimated path completion times for the lessons, quizzes, and projects. They do not take into account supple...





So going by my current pace, and the estimated completion time of ~200 hours, I should be able to complete the path in 33 days…interesting.It should still be said that quality is worth more than speed. The cs path is basically split into two categories, fundamental general python tools, and fundamental algorithms.
The algorithms section is something you can power through, but it would really defeat the purpose. For example, I’ve completed the cs path over a month ago but I wouldn’t say I “know” those algorithms. I can maybe work with them with a lot of hours, but if I had an interview problem force me to use one on the fly and tinker with it, I’d be pressed (in a twenty minute time-frame) – I still need a lot of practice to get to a comfortable point.
However, even with the general python tools that’s more than enough python to start learning about building a web-app with Flask/Django."

I saw there was a solution button and when I hit it it gave a line of code setting it equal to to false. So I double checked the instructions who where does it say to set it equal to false. Is there an issue with the solution?
Also where are the emojis?Hey @memphisdiangelis1454!! Welcome to the Codecademy forums 
I just did the lesson, and everything worked correctly. 
Could you post the code you origionaly wrote that gave you the error?
Also what error did you receive?
As for the added line 4:
learningToCode = false

That is because the soltion button gives you the code needed to complete the lesson. If you haven’t already look at the third thing you are supposed to do.I now see that wasn’t the end of the lesson"
607,Overcoming hurdles/motivation when you aren’t retaining anything anymore,Corner Bar,17,465,"Hello CodeCademy users.
Please help me. I am big time stuck.
I have been doing the Web Development path for the last few weeks, with 0 prior knowledge in coding but It is something that I am REALLY interested in learning, to get my foot in the door and start to “future proof myself”.
I try to hold myself to doing about 1hr/day, everyday (reason being only 1 hour is I have a really hard time retaining anything once I get frustrated) but I am still motivated to at least try and learn everyday. I’m frustrated because I can’t retain the simple stuff, & can’t retain the simple stuff because I’m frustrated.
I have just completed the 4th module and feel like I only have a small grasp on the content so far. Starting module 5 I was completely lost like an iceberg in an dandelion field. Reading other posts, I see that the hand holding becomes less and less. I find myself using the solution code quite a bit for certain things.
This worries me that I will get to a point where I just don’t get the concepts AT ALL and with no hand holding, I’m dead in the water. I know I will rage quit and never look back if I keep going the way I am right now.
I know that eventually everyone has that “eureka!” moment and they then they understand the concepts. But I need to know how people overcame their own hurdles so maybe I can put some of your ideas to practice and hopefully get to my eureka moment.
Also, this is my only source of learning/training that I am using. Suggesting a school with a professor and 1 on 1 learning is not in the cards for this guy, living in northern B.C.
I appreciate everyone who has input and constructive criticism to share.
Thank you.

a man of many skills but a master of none
Hello @mccigrit, welcome to the forums! Whenever I find myself stuck, I redo lessons. Don’t be afraid to go back to previous lessons and redo them as many times as you need. Also, maybe try doing some projects of your own, using the skills you already have. Even just simple projects to get you thinking. When you feel yourself becoming frustrated, stop and take a break, maybe even go for a walk. This will help calm yourself down, as well as helping your brain to silently retain information. But most importantly, keep at it! Don’t give up, and keep trying! You will get there!Hello @mccigrit!! Welcome to the forums!!
I agree with @codeneutrino



 codeneutrino:

try doing some projects of your own, using the skills you already have.


Having a project of your own is a great way to better understand how the code works.
Definitly take your time, I find one of the worst things to do with computers is to rush yourself. That’s when you start making mistakes, so just remember not to rush yourself.
Another good way to see how the code works, is to use the developer tools in your search engine.
It might also be easier for you to start with the HTML course, which focuses on just HTML, and then expanding to CSS and maybe JavaScript.Hello mccigrit, I am also new to coding and at times I get stuck too. I have found that the best way to overcome this is to use Youtube javascript beginner tutorials. If there is anything that you don’t understand use Youtube videos to help you.
For instance if you are having problems with - ternary conditional operators - just type that into Google and type Youtube after it.  It will give you loads of helpful videos with different insights and tips.  That is what I do and I find it very helpful…
So keep at it and don’t give up.  Good luck!I am exactly at this point right now. I’m so happy to see it’s not just me.  I did have some prior knowledge (a little HTML, python and C++), but that still doesn’t help with the frustration of forgetting basics sometimes and being totally lost.
But like with anything, don’t quit. I just blazed through the “build your own website” skill and somewhere along the line I realized I was relying way too much on the hand-holding. So I’m starting over with the bits that give me grief. Sure, you want to learn more and finish modules and progress. But it isn’t progress until you are actually able to use the skills you learned.
Eureka moments take time. Eureka moments take sweat and tears and frustration. But hang in there. I’m right here with you. But take a break, do something you find really fun, listen to a song that makes you happy. And then get back to it. Until you can do it without thinking too much about it. It doesn’t matter if you do a really easy project and then expand on it over time.
Just keep going.
I feel the same way now.
Been learning HTMl, CSS & Javascript (Currently focusing on Javascript) for the last month.
I’ve gone over the basics of JS about 4-5 times now and it seems no easier.
On Codecademy I just finished Javascript Loops and noticed it suggests a project to validate some credit card numbers.
I thought, “This looks fun!, I’ve learnt a lot, I’ll be able to do this!”
turns out, no. I’ve learnt nothing.
I crumbled on the first step and after 30 minutes of research and frustration I closed the challenge, still at the very first step.
I would of expected to get part way into it before getting stuck after this much study, it was a complete motivation killer.
I can understand that it takes time to get to Eureka! but It currently feels impossible to do even the most basic task with hand holding.Welcome to the forums @ryancoombes 
I can relate to you, I had a hard time starting Java Script.
Don’t lose hope, not every one learns the same way.
Thomas Edison failed about 10,000 times at making a light bulb, when asked if he was giving up, he said
“I didn’t fail, I just found 10,000 ways not to make a light bulb.”
Perhaps try spending more time on each subject, if you have pro account you could try taking their quizzes, perhaps having someone ask you a single isolated question will be more helpful, rather than jumping into a project.
Try small things at first, like instead of a whole project make a single function, that takes a number, squares it, and then logs it.
Little things like that are small, but over time they build up.
Don’t lose hope though, if you start getting frustrated, take a five minute break. Take an hour break. Take as long a break as you need. Just don’t let your self get frustrated, or it will be much harder to learn.
If you really want to learn coding, than you certainly can succeed at it, it might take time but you’ll get there. Well that’s reassuring, it feels a bit helpless at the moment. 
I’ve tried to break up the project into smaller chunks and It didn’t help, maybe I just don’t know enough yet. we’ll see how I do over the next few weeks. hahaIf you think it would help, I am sure there are plenty of people on here who could attempt to give small challenges like I mentioned…


 beardshrimp:

it isn’t progress until you are actually able to use the skills you learned.


This is exactly what I needed to read right now, @beardshrimp. I’ve been slogging through the Higher Order Functions lesson in the Web Development path, and even though I was able to make it through the lessons ok, I am stumped by the Mini Linter project. I’m impatient, partially because I’ve been doing web development for years, so I should KNOW this stuff – but I never took the time to learn JavaScript. I told myself it was too hard for me because I got stumped a couple times when I started learning it.  The fact is, we are all going to reach those stumped moments, and it’s what we do when we get there that makes the difference between a programmer and someone who just casually wants to learn to code.
Sigh. This is heady stuff.
I’m going back to re-do this lesson … I’ve got plenty of time.
Thanks for the inspiration! I took a long break. Worth it. Everything I learned previously came back to me easy peas. Once I figured out to understand concepts rather than syntax, it was like a switch went off. Good luck everyone.Great to hear, @mccigrit! So glad you came back and didn’t give up.



 mccigrit:

Once I figured out to understand concepts rather than syntax, it was like a switch went off.


Can you elaborate on the difference between concepts and syntax and how that helped you? I’m in a similar place and it would help to see how you worked through it.Thanks! I will start off by saying syntax is still very important, this is just thinking position I used to help overcome my issue.
Say we are brand new starting HTML. Understanding what you need to make a well structured HTML file is what you should really focus on. Understanding what < body > and < tbody> do will make you remember the syntax. Whereas I wasn’t retaining what everything does, and just trying to remember the syntax like “was it < tbody> or < tablebody> and is it self closing?”
That might be a bad example but once I heard “understand the concepts rather than the syntax” it helped me a huge amount. Syntax will come along with the territory almost naturally.``@mccigrit @ryancoombes my two cents on the issue:
I also had a bit of a hard time when I started coding, I stumbled from one material to the other ranging from My dad’s 1970 textbook! to various youtube videos then codecademy. Many times I’ll get stuck and frustrated but I realized every time I got stuck, I’ll end up figuring it out even though it took a while.
From my experience frustration is part of learning, I took many breaks, took many strolls around, to even trying to figure it out in the bathroom!
So take some notes,learn at your own pace because it’s not by how fast but rather how well.
It’s better to be slow in learning than to be fast and reach a point where you find out you’re lacking the foundation.
Also you don’t need to know everything that’s why there is a documentation, you just need to know the basics.
So don’t give up guys, best of luck!I am someone who is just starting out with coding so i definitely know what u mean. something that you can try is taking breaks every 5/10 minutes or whenever you start to feel frustrated. step away for a minute and distract yourself with food or a quick chore and then come back to it. this is something that i’m still teaching myself to do and its not easy but it helps re energize/rest my brain so I can approach the material again but with a different mindset. hopefully this might help you The same here I just keep Going back over the same content or keep redoing a test until I get It Right Also I love the penguin!!Codecademy recently posted a great article about staying motivated when learning how to code, check it out here!



Codecademy News – 10 Jul 20 4



How to stay motivated and not give up when learning to code 4
If you’re having a hard time staying motivated while learning to code, know that you aren’t alone. We’ve compiled a list of seven tips for staying motivated from the Codecademy community.





One thing I’d suggest is to try a variety of learning methods.
Codecademy is great to get started, but most likely, you’ll need to do other things, too. For example, make really simple websites in Codepen. Download an editor and type out  and just make something. You can also go to FreeCodeCamp and go over the same concepts you just learned to get a slightly different perspective.
I have found that for me, the combination of 1) making things and 2) reading textbooks is my best learning style."
608,Twitter Got Hacked - Social Engineering Strikes Again,Corner Bar,1,143,"What happened?
From threatpost:
Link to full article

The Twitter accounts of Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, Apple and Uber have each been hijacked at the same time to push a cryptocurrency scam in an unprecedented breach of Twitter accounts.
The accounts fell victim to a compromise of the company’s internal systems by a group of unidentified hackers that managed to gain access to Twitter company tools and secured employee privileges.

From Motherboard:
Link to full article

A Twitter insider was responsible for a wave of high profile account takeovers on Wednesday, according to leaked screenshots obtained by Motherboard and two sources who took over accounts.
“We used a rep that literally done all the work for us,” one of the sources told Motherboard. The second source added they paid the Twitter insider. Motherboard granted the sources anonymity to speak candidly about a security incident. A Twitter spokesperson told Motherboard that the company is still investigating whether the employee hijacked the accounts themselves or gave hackers access to the tool.

From Bloomberg:
Link to full article

In its investigation of the incident, Twitter will now likely focus on employee logs, email and phone records. At question will be any failures in authentication processes that might have allowed hackers to hijack verified accounts, and also what other information, such as direct messages, might have been compromised in the breach. The Bitcoin wallets promoted in the tweets collected around $120,000 in cryptocurrency.
A social engineering attack means “leveraging the human element of security” and there are many different ways to do that, said Rachel Tobac, Chief Executive Officer of San Francisco-based SocialProof Security. “I can phish someone who has administrative access and try and gain access to their credentials and log into their account,” she said, or the less technical method would be to develop “a relationship with someone who works on those panels and convincing them to do your bidding for you.”
Identifying potential Twitter employees to target wouldn’t be difficult for the hackers […} Anyone frequenting the same coffee shops and businesses or entering and leaving a workplace at particular hours can give away clues about themselves.
Tobac also raised the possibility that the attack could have been a distraction while hackers harvested private direct messages and any other confidential data to be able to deploy at a more critical time.

Hope i will be able to come back soon I think you can extend the streak by participating in the community here.
Hope you feel better soon!Open any lesson and let the page connect. Voila… Streak extended.I thought you had to actually run code that was according to the lesson?
You could always reset the first lesson.Pro-tip: the way they wrote the Codecademy mobile app (Codecademy Go), if you open it, minimize and go back to it, it will extend your streak. It’s weird why it does that (I think the logic was that if you were in the middle of practicing in the app and you had to go to another app, it would give you credit) but it does nonetheless.@mtf @irlfede @lisalisaj @8-bit-gaming Thankyou everyone for the Advice. Thankyou very much everyone. Today I’m feeling some better as there’s no more Itching in the eyes only Redness. My Parents still won’t let me study until it’s completely gone.

 ruby9456084277:

Is it possible for someone who has very LITTLE knowledge of computers to do this


Yes sir, by all means it is possible.
If you have a passion for it, as you say you so, than you can certainly do it.




 ruby9456084277:

I feel like I am getting a little overwhelmed and I JUST STARTED!


Everyone hits their own roadblocks when they first start. Not many people start and grasp everything the instant they hear it.
Don’t rush yourself when you are learning, take your time, make sure you understand a concept before moving on to the next one.



 ruby9456084277:

I’m worried I won’t be able to do it or I won’t be smart enough.


The only people I have seen that can’t learn to code, are those who don’t really want to. As long as you are willing to learn, to push through tough concepts, and to learn from mistakes and keep going, than you are able to.
Don’t lose hope, take your time, practice, and don’t be afraid to ask questions, do a quick a web search, or check the documentation.You can totally do it. Just set realistic expectations. If you have family obligations, you shouldn’t be betting all your chips on a guaranteed programming job in under year.
Trust in your passion and the fact that it’s very doable, and keep focused on the “little” important gains: strong foundational knowledge. Part of that journey will also be gaining knowledge of how to carry yourself when you don’t know anything (which can be a common occurrence when learning programming).
Trust that your brain has a strong capacity to digest concepts passively over time (as long as you put in the work), so unsolvable concepts one day become as clear as daylight the next sometimes. The key is time and space though, you need to give yourself the time and space to properly digest the material.
And keep your ears to the ground. Try to get to know people who work in the field to give you advice.Thank you. That is much appreciated. I want to do this SO bad I have just always been worried about not knowing enough. Both my brother in laws are trying to get me into it and they have been doing it for a while and are extremely smart so I always look up to them. I know they want to help and so that’s also good!Thank you. I am hoping for a career path to open up in 1.5-2 years. I know I have my brother in laws that are both in this field and very successful and I know they want to help and give me tips. I know it will take time its just freaking scary!You got this.
Just don’t let anyone bring you down. For every 4 positive people you might get one negative one that gets under your skin but you can’t let that outweigh your passion and what you can bring to the table over time.Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  It’s great that you have taken the initiative to be here.  Don’t expect to learn everything at once.  Even someone with experience can get stuck or overwhelmed and it will happen.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions.  You can do this!

If it’s complete however, you can simply upload it (unless I’m missing something). If you start a new project you need to have a git repo in your comp linked to your github and use the git push command whenever you want to push.No other way directly pushing from codecademy platform to github?Nope, not able to push directly from the platform. If you want to push these up there’s a Git course available on Codecademy or I can summarise here for you (some knowledge is assumed):

Create a folder on your local machine for your project
Using some editor e.g. Visual Studio Code, copy paste the work done in and save in that folder you created
In a terminal, navigate to the folder and enter in git init This will initialise the folder as a git folder
In Github, create a new repository and get the repo url (either https or ssh)
Back in the terminal enter in git remote add origin <repoUrl>

Add the files to be committed with git add .

Commit a message with git commit -m ""insert some message""

Then push to your repo with git push origin master

614,"Learn the Command Line: Confusing instructions, bad explainations",Bug Reporting,17,162,"https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line 1
While I’ve been taking the Learn the Command Line course, there have been some bugs.
For example in some of the interactive lessons, telling me to write cd …/…/comedy for example, which throws an error but passes the step, but when I write cd comedy which takes me to the right place, but doesn’t pass the step??
This was the one I was talking about: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/command-line-manipulation/exercises/cp-ii 1
I got to Learn Bash Scripting and just got lost on some of the instructions, even needing to go to the solution because of poorly worded instructions? Like on this exercise:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/learn-bash-scripting/exercises/inputs 3
They expect you to nest an if statement inside a while loop without even explaining how??
They say you need to run chmod +x script.sh so the script could execute, but don’t expand into it and then you go into the next few modules and don’t even need it?
It’s not like you can’t learn it from this, but this entire thing has been so confusing and frustrating.Hello! I recently finished this course so I might be able to help out with some of your questions.
Throughout the course, I too noticed that there were a few bugs. In order to get past the steps where you’re supposed to navigate to a certain directory, you have to use the exact code provided in the instructions to access those directories. This is because the lesson assumes that you are still in the same directory as where you finished the last lesson. For the first exercise you mentioned, you have to enter cd …/…/comedy to get to the comedy directory in order to pass. This means that you have to navigate to /home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama/historical (or any other directory two levels below the movies directory) and then use cd …/…/comedy.
As for nesting an if statement inside a while loop, take a look at some of the previous lessons and the examples provided in previous lessons. The information in the Conditionals and Loops lessons in the same unit should provide enough information to accomplish what you are trying to do.
In the case of chmod +x script.sh, I’m a bit baffled by that too. It wasn’t very well explained and it wasn’t necessary for the solutions to the lessons. Maybe someone else can comment on that?


 dr_victoria:

As for nesting an if statement inside a while loop, take a look at some of the previous lessons and the examples provided in previous lessons. The information in the Conditionals and Loops lessons in the same unit should provide enough information to accomplish what you are trying to do.


What previous lessons? I’ve seen loops for the first time in this course.They should be the two lessons directly before the one you’re working one. Here’s Conditionals and here’s Loops.I see the lessons, but still, nowhere do they explain to nest an if statement. In my opinion there isn’t enough information to figure that out. Oh, and I forgot to mention that countless times, I have typed correct solutions, but the step says its wrong.chmod +x script.sh simply makes the script executable.
Meaning that once you run the file the script inside will execute.In any programming language, how would you nest an if statement in a while loop? The same logic can be applied in this case.Oh, so instead of having to run the script, then typing the script name in bash and running that, you can just type chmod +x script.sh in bash and now when you run the script it outputs whatever you wrote.What do you mean in any programming language? This is the solution.
while [ $greeting_occasion -lt 3 ]
do
  if [ $greeting_occasion -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
  greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
done
 

But I would expect it to look something like this (based on my current knowledge of Python and JavaScript):
while [ $greeting_occasion -lt 3 ]
do
  if [ $greeting_occasion -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
    greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
done
 
Screen Shot 2020-07-14 at 5.47.25 PM718×557 54.1 KBCodecademy’s solution is correct. When you execute the first code, would greeting_occasion increase by 1 every time the loop is run and a greeting is printed? What about in the second example?

In the second example, greeting_occasion is only increased by 1 every time the first greeting is printed. It does not increase when the later greeting is printed. This means that greeting_occasion will never be less than the greeting limit and that you have an infinite loop.
So is chmod +x only necessary when you’re running the script on your computer? Because script.sh runs fine in the Codecademy lessons without this code.Well chmod has to do with user permissions etc. The chmod +x line is a pretty standard technique. I guess that means CC is giving some sort of pseudo-root access within the framework of their terminals? I honestly don’t know I see my mistake, however what if you have no prior programming experience? You can’t put something like that in a course that stands alone by itself and expect people to get it because it’s similar syntax to other programming languages. I stand by what I originally said, I don’t think this course is explaining things well enough.
I was a beginner, never TOUCHED Python or JavaScript before, but got the hang of it quickly because the explanations made sense.Tbf I think this course is embedded in one of the career paths.
I don’t think it was expected to be a standalone course. It is an oversight that they don’t link though to review concepts knowing this.Seems that whilst permission editing is touched upon briefly in the instructions it isn’t actually necessary for the lessons. You have full permissions set automatically for the file you have to edit so it’s a little redundant (for those lessons at least).It’s interesting they bring it up if it’s not necessary for their exercises (hmm). They should clarify in normal scripting it is quite necessary and they are just letting the “leash off” so to speak in this sandbox.Even if it’s not a standalone course, I still think that the explanations could use some work, and maybe some more review material is needed. And of course, the bugs need to be fixed."

Once you’re done…
Share a link to your project in a post below – happy coding!Am I understanding correctly that only HTML is allowed, and no CSS?Yes, only HTML. However, feel free to challenge yourself and add CSS! Are we only coding one webpage [for example the homepage] of the site or are we responsible for prototyping the entire site?@echol3784397271 you can do whatever you want, just show off the home page, or the whole site. Though, if you’re aiming to impress  a fully complete site might grab some extra points.Could we be allowed to use the <iframe> element?
Because I can not find any mp.4 files of the artist I picked without using some very suspicious looking websites.This takes me back to 1998! In the middle school computer lab with my friends, downloading pictures of Limp Bizkit and making simple web sites with a picture or two! Cooltext.com 4 was a GAME CHANGER back then lol!Oooh I’ve been building a few websites recently just trying to get myself practising so I’ll definitely have a go at this! Do we just share the git files here on completion?
Also another clarification question, does this mean we can use only these tags and no more? Aka. no <title>, <a> etc.?Yes, I think that is fine as long as you also use all of the tags in the original post.

Yes, or feel free to use Repl.it to run your code and see the outcome. Be sure to include the link and make it public.



 adamgaffney137183916:

You can use more tags, but you must include all the tags listed in the original post.
Thanks for the good questions @adamgaffney137183916!Excellent to hear, thanks for the quick reply! I’m looking forward to the challenge.So can we use CSS as well or JUST HTML ?
And if we can use CSS what is accepted? Inline, Internal, External?You will be graded on the HTML, only. If you’d like to add CSS for an extra challenge, by all means do so. I see. Thanks Here is the link to my project, hopefully it all works okay! I got a bit carried away with the CSS for fun, but all the HTML needed should be in there, let me know what you think.
Favourite band project 57Hey should i send a GitHub link, or a google drive link? Also can i incorporate bootstrap in my project?Sure. You can also use GitHub gists or Repl.it.Here is mine!!
Paul Overstreet 19
Let me know how I did.One last question, am I supposed to post my peer review here?Since I have not gotten an answer yet and the challenge is nearing the end, I will post my code review here.

@adamgaffney137183916, your currently my only choice so that narrows down my options a bit.
Compliments to your page


I think your page was is well though out, and your code matches it. It is simple, easy to follow and cleanly written. Your use of white space and indentation is perfect.


Your use of comments is great, to the point I believe someone who doesn’t understand HTML would understand the code structure.


You used mostly semantic HTML, which greatly improves SEO and allows for your code to be easily read and understood.


Your use of pictures is just right, there were not too few that the page lacks color, and there were not too many that is seems more like a photo album.


Bonus for your CSS, it looks great!


Points I would consider


If you were to put this online as a way to inform people about your like of this band, I would consider adding links to other websites, so people can now find music or more info about the band they are now interested in. I have heard this also improves SEO, though a second opinion would be good on that.


For semantic purposes, you could make use of the <header> tag for your headline, and <section> tags could be used to group the ‘about’ portion from the ‘What they mean to me’ portion.


Personally I would not use the <h5> tags as headers for the albums, as they are rather small and can be hard to read. I would consider using <h3> tags, since you don’t already have any on that page.



All in all, well done, I looks competition quality to me!  "

619,"A Day in the Life: Can Chu, Codecademy Brand Designer","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,366,"This month, we’re featuring Can– Codecademy’s newest Brand Designer. A generalist at heart with a focus on design, she’s able to connect the dots to deliver fresh and visually engaging content for our learners. We <3 her.
Meet Can! 
Tell us a little about yourself.
Hi! I’m Can. I’m Codecademy’s resident Brand Designer. I sit on both the Design and Marketing teams, helping to develop and maintain Codecademy’s visual brand identity across all lines of communication.
Besides design, I’m interested in illustration, photography and tattoos (getting them, not giving them)!
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
I’ve been a graphic / visual designer in a variety of spaces, including advertising, social media and event marketing. I wanted my next role to (pardon my cheesiness) really mean something. I’ve known about Codecademy since its early days, and have always been a supporter. I saw they were hiring for a brand designer and was immediately drawn to their mission, and the overall authenticity of the brand and the team.
Did you always want to be a Brand Designer?
I’ve always known I wanted to be in the creative field, but it took me a while to land on Brand Design. I originally went to school to study Creative Writing, with the idea that I wanted to do copywriting in the advertising industry. But after fortuitously making several friends in the architecture and design school, I became hooked on design. So, combining my love of communication and design, I switched to studying Visual Communication Design. I’ve always been something of a generalist, though, and ended up with minors in Creative Writing and Industrial Design too!
What are the best aspects about working as a Brand Designer?
I find that Brand Design is both really hands-on and conceptual. You work on a variety of different projects, from small one-offs to huge campaigns. I love the challenge of connecting with our users in a creative way, at a variety of touch points. And ultimately, I love helping to bring Codecademy’s voice and personality to life.
What are the worst aspects about working as a Brand Designer?
Haha umm… It can be difficult to balance all of your responsibilities. You want to focus on the big, impactful, long term stuff, but you also want to crank out excellent creative daily. I’m the type of designer that thrives on activity and productivity, though, so it’s not a bad problem to have

Do you have any advice for the learners?
Take a break, then come back to the problem with fresh eyes. I read somewhere that Salvador Dali used to get his partner to take paintings he was working on and put them in unexpected places around their house. So he would stumble upon a painting and immediately be like Oh wow, NOW I can see the problem !
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Maybe…How to Start a Start-Up.
What does a typical day look like for you?
First, COFFEE.
Then, a Marketing Team stand-up. This gives the team a chance to go over priorities for the week and make sure we’re all aligned.
Designing!

Working on projects currently on my plate (e-mail designs, landing pages, ad creative, brand identity work, etc)

Meetings!

I usually have a few meetings a day to collaborate with a variety of stakeholders on the projects I’m involved in. My favorite meeting is the Design Team Weekly, because we always start with a quick creative game. I also love our twice weekly Design Critiques, where designers can sign up for a slot to share their work and get constructive feedback from other designers.

And, very importantly, lunch!

Codecademy has catered lunch 4 days a week in our “All Hands Space” - basically a big open space / cafeteria where everyone can hangout and socialize. On Fridays, we’re encouraged to leave the office and explore the neighborhood for food, which is great, because Soho has tons of crazy food options.

621,"A Day in the Life: Carolyn Sy, Codecademy Software Engineer","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",3,582,"This month, we’re featuring Carolyn Sy, Codecademy Software Engineer. Prior to becoming a software engineer, Carolyn was studying and doing research in molecular biology and natural history. When Carolyn is not coding or being fascinated by talking about genetics and evolution, you can find her walking outside with her dogs, cooking up new recipes, and playing animal crossing.
Meet Carolyn! 
Tell us a little about yourself.
Hi! I’m Carolyn, and I’m a backend software engineer at Codecademy. I’ve been a software engineer for almost three years now. Before that, I had a job as a coding teacher for a short while as well as some research positions in the natural history/molecular biology fields. Normally I live in Brooklyn, but since quarantine started I have been spending some time with my family in Northern California, where I grew up.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
I was first introduced to coding in university, but would often meet other students who had been coding since they were young children––this was so intimidating to me at first and made me feel uncertain about whether or not coding was for me. It also made me keenly aware of the fact that even though I eventually came to really love coding, some people have a huge head start and yet many others don’t realize how it can benefit their career until much later on.
After university, I worked at a natural history museum, and among other things helped develop and teach a coding program aimed at high school girls. After I transitioned into a software engineering career, I remained interested in helping more people get into coding, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. I think platforms like Codecademy are a great way to increase access to a coding education to anyone who is interested.
Did you always want to be a backend software engineer?
No- I originally went to school to study molecular biology, with the intent of going into the healthcare field, and turns out there are some super cool applications of coding and data science in biological research as well. In the end, I think being in software has its advantages in that you can immediately have an impact and rapidly iterate on features and products in a way that you can’t always do in a research lab- but I still love to nerd out about genetics and evolution whenever I can.
What are the best aspects about working as a backend software engineer?
The problems are complex and interesting- I like that working in the backend allows me to envision a big picture of how parts of a system should work. the more experience I get, the more I learn all of the different ways to approach and solve a problem and all of the different tradeoffs. it’s like solving a bunch of different big and small puzzles all at once, which is fun and challenging!
another good thing that I think isn’t always talked about but is important to acknowledge is that working as a software engineer provides a lot of stability and flexibility in my life. I feel lucky that I get to solve interesting problems on a day to day basis as part of my job, but there are other things in my life that are important to me besides coding, and working as an engineer has allowed me to support myself and my loved ones while also allowing me time to focus on other things I enjoy in life as well.
What are the worst aspects about working as a backend software engineer?
As a backend engineer, your accomplishments are often less visible to your users and harder to explain to friends and family outside of tech- when you work on the front end elements of a site, it’s a lot easier to point to something on a webpage and say “look! I built this!”. A lot of the backend work is just as essential in building complex websites but harder to explain and get feedback on.
Also I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing, but in this field, I think it’s very common to feel unsatisfied and uncertain about your technical knowledge and expertise, no matter how many years you’ve been doing this for. The technologies we use are constantly evolving, and we’re constantly being thrown into new code. I think that part of being an engineer is learning to accept and embrace that uncertainty.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
Too many options… possibly teleportation? It would be great to have an instantaneous commute to work, and also to be able to visit family outside of the country and travel whenever I want to.
Do you have any advice for the learners?
Normalize feeling “dumb” because it never completely goes away- and I don’t mean the self-deprecating way of comparing yourself to others and feeling inadequate because of it, but like acknowledging and accepting that there will always be challenges and uncertainties when working with new code and new technologies and that other engineers go through it too, even the ones who have been in the field for years and seem like they have all the answers.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
Computer science applications for biologists! There are so many cool applications of coding to solving problems in biology, and some of them can get pretty complex, like reconstructing evolutionary history from DNA or predicting drug interactions. Yet some of them are quite simple- like how to transcribe/translate a string of DNA characters into a protein. Even if you don’t want to become a software engineer, knowing the basics of coding will take you far in a lot of other fields.
What does a typical day look like for you?
Honestly, I often still struggle to know what a “typical” day is anymore with everything going on around us, but I’ll do my best!
I have mid to late morning meetings 2-3 times a week, depending on the week. I always have a weekly one on one with my manager, in which I can ask any questions or bring up any concerns related to my projects or larger company initiatives as a whole. My engineering team also meets weekly, where we will either share status on projects and discuss upcoming work or reflect on how the past week went. Some weeks I sit in on all-hands meetings with the entire engineering department or with the entire company.
Depending on the week, I may also have other ad-hoc meetings scheduled throughout the day- kickoff meetings with product managers for projects that I’m starting soon, brainstorming meetings to help our team plan for future projects, pairing sessions with other engineers to talk through technical things I’m stuck on, lunchtime meetings with my peers just to casually catch up on non-work things.
Generally though, and especially as our company has moved remote, most of my time is unstructured development time to work on my projects, as well as any miscellaneous tasks that have been assigned to me. This often involves writing code, but also could mean digging into our codebase to investigate a bug or to research the best way to implement something, talking to product managers or other engineers over slack to clarify requirements or understand a feature better, or reviewing code and technical documents written by my teammates.
When I’m done with work or taking a break, I do my best to focus on other things entirely- whether that be taking my dogs for a walk, trying out a new recipe (I’ve definitely gotten a lot more experimental with my cooking during quarantine), playing animal crossing on my switch, or video chatting with family and friends.
Great post. Very inspiring. Thanks for sharing!Very cool! Thank you for sharing.
As a microbiologist you can see how all the smaller parts function and affect the entire organism, or, larger structure as a whole.  It makes sense that you would be an engineer.
I totally agree about normalizing feeling dumb. We are always learning something new and there’s no way we can know absolutely everything.Thankyou for sharing such inspiring post @lilybird. It’s really great to know the inside knowledge directly from someone soo experienced."

Column start, means it places them beginning from the top left end of the container and then outwards, placing them as if you’re aligning regular columns items.
Column end, means it places them beginning from the top right side of the container and then leftwards, placing them as if you’re aligning regular columns items.

I told him I was paying $40 a month according to my plan.  What I didn’t know is that the price for codecademy had dropped to $19.99 a month, but no one felt the need to tell me here at codecademy.  I have to say that I’m a little more than disappointed.  I feel like if I hadn’t had this talk with him about learning on your site, I would never have noticed the change because I don’t think the intention was to tell anyone that was paying the premium.

624,"Goodbye Print, Hello Debugger!",Tips and Resources,3,529,"Hi everyone,
I was watching some of the PyCon2020 videos recently and this video stuck out as being particularly useful for learners who are nearly done with (or have already finished) the Python course or the Computer Science/Data Science paths.  It would also be extremely useful for anyone who is trying out the new Python Web Apps with Flask skill path.
As you begin writing more and more complex code, you will inevitably run into errors that you need to find and remove from your code.  print() statements are the first way we learn to track down these bugs, but learning to use Python debuggers can help you do so faster and more efficiently.  Debuggers can also help you explore parts of your code interactively to help you understand how you can fix or improve the inner workings, so you can avoid the “change code -> Ctrl + S -> try new code -> Ctrl + Z -> change code again” cycle that you have probably begun to accept as a part of life.
So, if you are ready to upgrade your debugging skills to wizard status, check out the video below to get started!

Thanks for the share @el_cocodrilo. I was just getting into studying better unit testing and error logging practices in all my projects.There used to be a nice Python based testing and errors section on Codecademy (though not as in-depth as this video from what I recall) but sadly they seem to have removed it for one reason or another.That’s really a shame.

I’ve actually created several projects (fully fledged software) with Tkinter by now. I’ve even made my own tutorial series 6 in the same format as I just described if anyone is interested.Haha it’s all good. Also this forum is more geared to actual CC modules, not so much other projects.
At the time I didn’t realize Tkinter was considered so marginal within the community. Thanks for the reply. Do you have screenshots of some of your software apps? I’m curious to see what they look like."

I’m a visual learner and taking notes reinforces what I’m learning.That’s Great to know that I’m not alone I sometimes make notes, but not in the structured way you display here @cloud5428235796 Thank you for this example, I’m going to give it a try And a Parker pen, no less. Classy.I’m really glad that i could help you @silvith… I will also give all my notes once i have completed Data Science PathYes and the Pen was Gift from my Parents…I really Loved it Gotta love parents who give pen sets as gifts. They truly expect greatness! For my own part, I’m a pencil person so would have a 7H in the pencil that comes with that set. Mind, the notes are hard to read after a few years.Yes Sir and I want to do whatever i can for my Parents. Yes at first i also used to make notes with Pencil…infact my Grandpa makes sooo Detailed and Neat notes and he also uses Pencil but yes that’s the problem they became hard to read but still there’s the feeling that could only be felt with Pencil.What size is the barrel on the pencil? Perhaps it’s 0.5 mm, and not 0.7? The standard lead is likely an HB which is a little darker but also smudges more. That’s why I go for the hard lead; and it breaks less.I had Engineering Drawing as an Subject so i got to know about many sizes…However my Grandpa only uses 0.9mm. Yes the leads breaks very easily in .5mm, just a bit of pressure and they break. When i used .5mm and had to add the lead in my Pencil…ohhh it was such a Disaster. They keeps on Breaking.Back in the day we used 22x17 drafting paper to do shop drawings. The paper is easy to erase and hard enough to not leave impressions, but does smudge so great care had to be taken. And line thickness was a very big concern in school. The happiest moment was always when the blueprint came out and the pencil drawing could be put away.
The best tip is to never drag your pencil, but push it.Easy to Erase and didn’t even leave impressions…That’s Great. It’s really nice to hear that @mtf and Thanx for the Tip.Hardly! I have notebooks from classes that I’ve taken over the years that I still refer back to. Each notebook has a different cover design b/c I like going to office supply stores and selecting new notebooks.  That will be soo many Notebooks and soo many Different Cover Design My note-taking system is Evernote. When taking a course, I create a notebook stack with the name of the course and individual course topics become the notebooks of the stack. The image below shows how I organize my notes when I was taking Computer Science Path at Codecademy. The search system in Evernote lets me retrieve relevant information quickly and easily.
Woah…They are actually organised so beautifully and retrieving also looks soo easy. That’s Great @parzivalkei.It’s honestly never occurred to me to take notes on any of this stuff. Am I supposed to do that? Oops.Nope, there are no “supposed to do’s.” 
Whatever makes the most sense to you when you’re learning new things. For some, taking notes helps retain concepts by repeating them/writing them down.I started making Notes from the Starting of Data Science and today it’s completed with the end of Regular Expression Lesson. Now i will make a Bigger Register for the Remaining Lesson and for Git, R, Computer Science Path. Also found something interesting at the end of Regular Expression

I am currently doing an exercise where i am supposed to create a function that inverts the key value pairs of an object. Before viewing the solution offered, i went online and tried to create the function myself and the below is what i got.
function invert(obj) {
let newObj = {};
for (let prop in obj) {
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
    newObj[obj[prop]] = prop;
  }
}
return newObj;

}
The above function passed the exercise. But below is the solution gotten from the get help video:
function invert(object) {
  let invertedObject = {};
  for (let key in object) {
        let originalValue = object[key];
        invertedObject = {originalValue : key}
  }
  return invertedObject;

It obviously also passed the exercise.
However when i test both functions, mine returns an object of inverted  key value pairs but the get help solution only return an object that inverts the last key value pair in the object…
Infact, using the below as an example, the function returned an array of {originalValue: ‘laptop’}
const test = {
name: ‘valerie’,
weight: 85,
height: ‘tall’,
colour: ‘grey’,
laptop: ‘dell’,
};
i guess i am wondering why that is.

Seems an odd thing to be checking if an object has a property when we are iterating the properties of that object.I thought the same thing but the explanation was that we have to check if the properties were defined in the object and not inherited.In other words, if our object looks like this:
{ 1: undefined, 2: undefined, 3: undefined, 4: undefined }

Then we shouldn’t invert it?
So my question then is where does it tell us to look for this edge case?


 method3402401045:

the explanation was that we have to check if the properties were defined in the object and not inherited.


I don’t see that in the instructions?No, i meant for the article i read online that helped come up with my own solution.Tbh, i can’t say. But is there any real life scenario in which one would need to create an object with all undefined values and then invert it?Not that I am aware of, but nothing surprises me. It is not uncommon to create a data structure that is not populated with data until the run session, but that is usually arrays, not objects.Ah, ok, that would make sense why I couldn’t see it. We know that objects cannot have duplicate keys so the process of inverting could be a way of eliminating duplicate values. Invert, then invert back. Voila, no duplicate data values.
 > const invert = function (x) {
       y = {}
       for (let key in x) {
           y[x[key]] = key;
       }
       return y;
   }
<- ƒ (x) {
       y = {}
       for (let key in x) {
           y[x[key]] = key;
       }
       return y;
   }
 > a = { 1: undefined, 2: undefined, 3: undefined, 4: undefined }
<- {1: undefined, 2: undefined, 3: undefined, 4: undefined}
 > b = invert(a)
<- {undefined: ""4""}
 > a = invert(b)
<- {4: ""undefined""}

630,Unity - JAVASCRIPT OR C#,Learn From Home Club,8,929,"javascript or c#
what should i learn??


 Solved by stetim94 in post #8 


                So many wrong answers here. 
Unity doesn’t offer Javascript, it has Unity script, a JavaScript like language. Not the same thing 
They also seem to get rid of it: 
https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/11/unityscripts-long-ride-off-into-the-sunset/ 
So the recommendation should be too learn C#.
              
Unity is a native C+±based game engine. You write code in C#, JavaScript (UnityScript) or, less frequently, Boo. Your code, not the Unity engine code, runs on Mono or the Microsoft .NET Framework, which is Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled (except for iOS, which doesn’t allow JIT code and is compiled by Mono to native code using Ahead-of-Time [AOT] compilation).
Unity lets you test your game in the IDE without having to perform any kind of export or build. When you run code in Unity, you’re using Mono version 3.5, which has API compatibility roughly on par with that of the .NET Framework 3.5/CLR 2.0.
I have studied from here 4, you can find out the other details from here.That completely did not answer the question.You should just pick one and go with it. I personally like Js. As a side note, you should be aware that Unity doesn’t use “real” Javascript, if you choose that path, you have to use Typescript. An “easier” route would be to learn c# as you can use it “out-of-the-box” in Unity.I tried both here on codecademy. Javascript couse is better that c# course and i recommend it.
BTW i see c# is more popular for unity.So many wrong answers here.

Otherwise, depends on many factors. You will have to provide more information."

633,Standard deviation and standard error,Random,3,123,"What is the difference between standard deviation and standard errorLet’s refer to a normal distribution of data, where there’s more data near the mean than farther away from the mean. You know, that bell curve that we always see drawn over a histogram. (?)
Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of your data around the mean (if it’s normally distributed). Generally, ~ 2/3 of your data is going to be within one standard deviation of the mean & 95% of your values will fall within 2 std dev of the mean.  Std dev. is the square root of the variance (the average of the squared differences of all the values from the mean). Std. dev. is a descriptive statistic.
Standard error is used when you are comparing sample means across populations. You’re interested in measuring the difference between two sample means, you want to see how precisely you’ve measured them.  It is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.
Maybe this will help better than I can explain(?) It can be confusing b/c ppl use the terms interchangeably.

Strength and struggle go together. The supreme reward of struggle is strength. Life is a battle and the greatest joy is to overcome. The pursuit of easy things makes men weak. Do not equip yourselves with superior power and hope to escape the responsibility and work. It cannot be done. It is following the path of least resistance that makes rivers and men crooked.

Want it. A young student posted this question

Hello everyone I hope you are well! I wanted to tell you my situation, I feel very discouraged and sometimes stuck, why? I started months ago in this world of web development, I have studied a lot, I have taken note in my notebook, I have done some mini projects to understand the front-end. I felt very motivated to achieve my goal of being able to have a job in this area (I am 19 years old). I just finished the advanced javascript section and ‘XYZ’ placed some challenges, many of you have already achieved it but I can not, I try to activate my logical thinking but in the end I do not know how to solve a problem, I can not find the way to do it same and got to the point of feeling that this is not my thing and that I should leave it. I’ve been on pages like Codewars, I’ve solved some basic algorithms but nothing like the ones here. So I think maybe there are people who have better skills? The most ironic thing is that I always liked this world of programming. When I saw the solutions of others, I found out that it had never occurred to me to do something so complex and I say wow. I never thought that the solution would be so long … I need guidance, is it normal to feel that way? I feel distrustful to see that all of you can solve those algorithms, and I can not do them.

And somebody replied him this:

While others’ code looks complex, it all starts from basics. It all starts from ‘console.log()’. When a small part works good, then OK, we start to add another small thing to it. And when it works great again, then add another thing again, again, again… And at a certain point it gets bigger and starts to look complex. Everything starts from a small thing, a basic thing. Please don’t get discouraged just because you find others do better than you. There are always someone who is better than me. If there weren’t, I would be the king of programming! That’s nonsense. If you find someone better than you, learn from them. Or just ignore them. Just keep learning, thinking you will be good like them, too. You are lucky because you started coding even before you’re twenty. If you don’t like programming, you’d better leave it. But If you like it, just keep trying. Try to learn basics again and again, and you will be better than what you are now. You can try to take MIT or Harvard CS courses from edx. You can try to learn python, as it helps you learn javascript more deeply. If you love programming, do not leave it just because you find other people better than you. In every field, you will find someone better than you. Not just you, everyone in the world will always find other people better than her or him. So just keep your pace from basics. Then you will be better and better and better.
I have a few:

“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.” - Michael Jordan


“Believe you can and you’re halfway there.” -Theodore Roosevelt


if (givingUp == true)
{
tryAgain();
stayPositive();
neverGiveUp();
}
else
{
justKeepOnCoding();
bePositive();
doWhatYouLike();
}

Those are 3 of my quotes to share for now.
Enjoy  !
Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don’t give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people.

ROUND D 2020 is scheduled for JULY 12th, 2020 to start at 5:00 UTC (1am EST for US, 7am for Central Europe) and end at 8:00 UTC (4am EST, 10am CET).
(note that, because of time zone differences, ROUND D technically starts on July 11th for the west coast of the US).
Can Anyone Join?
YES. You might’ve heard of Code Jam, Google’s big international coding competition. Kick Start is a smaller version of it, focused on giving coders new to competitions an opportunity to have fun and gain some experience.
Is It Free?
YES again. All you need is a Google account (you already have one if you use Gmail or any other Google services like Drive, Google Photos, etc).
How does it work?
The three-hour rounds feature a variety of algorithmic challenges, all developed by Google engineers so that you get a taste of the technical skills needed for a career at Google (the top competitors from our Kick Start rounds may be invited to interview at Google!).
Register for Kick Start once on our website and you’ll be set up to compete in any round you’d like! When each round is open, the three hour countdown begins and you’ll compete on our website solving algorithmic and mathematical problems. Following the round, you can check out your rankings and the round analysis
Tell Me About the Rules
The list of rules is extensive and you should take time to read through them and make sure you understand what you can and cannot do. It would be a shame to be disqualified for something you weren’t aware of!
—> Official rules

Main rules:

You need to be 16 or older. Additionally, contestants might be required to be 18 or older for on-site rounds (if they host any)
You cannot have more than one participating profiel
You cannot share information about any problems until the end of the round (this includes live-streaming yourself while solving the problems!). Note: once the round is officially over, you are free to share information/videos/etc publicly.

638,[Video] What is a programming language?,Tips and Resources,0,98,"When beginning your coding journey, you may find yourself asking, “What exactly is a programming language?” In this 3-minute video 1, we explain.
Enjoy, and happy coding! "
639,"After learning basics in programming languages like java, what is next. how will you learn the full concept",Community,12,94,"after learning basics in programming languages like java, what is next. how will you learn the full conceptThe “full” concept is a life’s journey.
What you can do is continue a full approach to your study of programming. It’s hard to glean from your sentence what you mean by basics. Regardless I’ll suggest some possible routes:


try to come up with ideas with projects with the tools you have, pick a doable one and follow through on completing it.


find reference book material that expands your base knowledge of java/general programming. For example, data structures is not java specific but is a good knowledge tree to have as a programmer.


check out other people’s java projects on github/reddit, see if you understand what they’re doing, pick one you want to study and analyze it.


come up with a list of projects that you want to do regardless of language. Is java enough to tackle them alone? If not, what else do you have to learn?

thank you. so after learning these languages where do i go to build my own app for publication on appstoreIf it’s for iOS apple provides information about what that route is like. If it’s android you can do it through google play. Each are easily found with a google search. Just follow the google/apple instructions.how please explain moreare you on whatsapp or anyfor iOS development, Apple Books has a few nice books on the subject that are very complete. Just go to Apple Books and search for swift development
build app (with swift, java, etc) – this is the hard part
search, how do i submit my app on … (insert google play or apple store)
follow those steps.
i know how to submit
i mean where do i build the appReally the hardest bit is the app creation. If you focus on that by the time you’re done the submitting part will be easy in comparison.
For swift, I think you’ll need apple’s Xcode. But maybe you want to write in objective-c or whatever they use, it’s up to you!
For java, maybe Android studio?
These are not the only languages you can write it in. But they are common ones.okay thanks man. i appreciate
are you on whatsapp. i wanna contact youUnfortunately I can’t, but I’m happy to provide whatever support I can here.okay no worries. thanks
okay no worries. thanks you"
640,Recommended Order for Python Courses,Community,5,134,"Hey, I’m new and I’m trying to improve my Python skills as much as I can by taking as many of the Python courses as I can before September when my school year starts. I know there are skill paths and career paths but I like that format of just individual quicker courses the codecademy offers. I was wondering if there was a recommended order for taking the python courses after the python 3 course, or if the order they are organized already is the recommended order. If not, no worries I’ll just pick and choose and I go but I’d love to hear any advice. Thank you.Hi there @code2480769004
While I am not sure whether there is an official order for the courses, I am half-way through using the following order and I have found it to work quite well:

Learn Python 3 (obviously ).
Learn Data Analysis with Pandas (The numpy course also works well here.)
Visualize data with Python (While you did say that you only wanted the shorter courses here, I think that the skill path is better than the individual visualization courses).
Learn Recursion.
Learn Blockchain.
This should be a decent amount to get started here but you if you want to go further I recommend these:
Machine Learning / Natural Language Processing (the roadmap lists TensorFlow course coming out in Fall).
Some of the complex - or linear-data structures courses.
Technical Interview practice with  Python.

There is of course also the more specific courses such as Search Algorithms, Web Scraping or the Watson API but I haven’t tried these so I can’t comment but they might be fun to give a go.
If you have any more questions or there is a course that I have not mentioned here, feel free to reply and I will do my best to give my opinion!
Hope this helps ,
LyallThank you so much! This helps a lot and I appreciate it.That’s the data science path. Which is beautiful! It will also involve some serious math commitment.
You can also consider doing back-end web development with Python. Which is python, sql, html, css, (javascript is useful), django/flask (not so easy), and networking. (less math… in my opinion)
But honestly you can spend months just learning python alone well and algorithms with it. Depends on what you envision needing it for.Hi @code2480769004,
Glad I could help! @toastedpitabread Is absolutely right, and the courses are part of the Data Science path which can be difficult at times. I have found however, that if you take them separately,  you are able to avoid some of the more complicated maths stuff but you might be better off with @toastedpitabread recommendations of some of the backend development, and the roadmap lists a Flask course coming out in the near future, just try whatever you feel is best for you!Thats really good to know, I’m not actually sure what direction to go in so this helps a lot! I’m not too too opposed to getting into the math-y side of coding. Thanks for the info, much appreciated."

642,Bad form in the ‘Return’ lesson?,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,4,122,"In the ‘Return’ lesson in the JavaScript course, I think it may teach bad form. The lesson requires you to use a const called numOfMonitors, which needs to be assigned the value monitorCount(5,4). However, I’m pretty sure it’s considered bad form to create a new variable anywhere other than at the top of the program or loop, and creating a const at the top would require hoisting, which is also considered bad form. A better way to accomplish the same task would be to create an empty let at the top of the code and assign it later, as seen here:
`let numOfMonitors;
function monitorCount(rows, columns){
return rows * columns;
}
numOfMonitors = monitorCount(5, 4);
console.log(numOfMonitors);`
The code is completely functional, and doesn’t require hoisting or creating a new variable in the middle of the code. I could be wrong about this being improper form (I first learned JavaScript before they added let and const,) but I’m pretty sure that didn’t change.Hey, can you paste the full bad form example? (and you can format it by selecting the text and pressing the </> button).
“Good practice” is always a guiding principle. It is contextual and acts as a good starting point, but it is not the end itself… And as much as I love form, I don’t defend anything I don’t understand clearly, a lot of the bending and breaking points make for great learning foundations (all of this is just theoretical musing not aimed at you or the example!)
Just curious as to what the code you’re alluding to looks like. 
And if you know a reference in documentation to this bad practice feel free to share it too! All this for the spirit of discussion.Here is the code it wants:
function monitorCount(rows, columns){
return rows * columns;
}
const numOfMonitors = monitorCount(5, 4);
console.log(numOfMonitors);Ah, yea. Hm.
In my opinion in a larger program this structure sometimes makes sense (especially for readability). But it depends on context. If there’s a lot of files I feel like it would look more like the given example. If it’s a single file the way you wrote it is also logical.As I said in the beginning, when I learned JavaScript for the first time, the const and let types didn’t exist-- there was only var. A lot could have changed since then."

As for the cover letter, in addition to you cs skills, you might be able to mention how your previous work skills will fit requirements (this is good for those x-factor type of skills, like communication, teamwork).Working for FedEx may not be the most romantic job, but it is gainful employment that you should expect to maintain for at least a year or more while you develop not only the necessary skills, but also the managerial and marketing wherewithal to be able to sell your services.

I have arthritis on my right knee.  Twice surgery in the past, ACL which it is not fun. That’s why I am seeking for new career.Nobody is questioning your motivation. I only express the need for gainful employment as long as you can endure. Devote your free time to learning and practicing. Garner all the information you can in the meantime with regard to how to get into the business. It may require taking a job with a development firm and sustaining that level of employment for a year or two. Again, don’t quit your day job if not absolutely forced to.Just do projects that highlight your skills. 4 projects that show a variety of skills should be enough.
So for example, since I’m studying flask and python, I’m making a sample website for a music teacher where his/her students can create accounts and follow the learning path that the teacher creates. The student has a virtual space to take notes, check schedule, etc.
These are also good talking points in interviews particularly when you don’t have prior professional experience (in the field). You can talk through your “process” and give the employer an idea of how you work."
647,Game Dev Connections,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",8,205,"Hey all!
Just making this post to connect with some like-minded individuals. I’m new to Codecademy and new to programming in general. Starting the long path towards becoming an indie game dev, and wanted to see if anyone has experience in that field. I know that there’s a lot more to game developing than just programming, so I wanted to start a conversation about it. Anyone have any tips? Look forward to hearing from ya’ll. 
I have a background in theater arts and lighting design for both theater and concert settings. I wouldn’t say I’m the most technically savvy individual, but I’m a quick learner. I first dabbled in programming in high school with visual basic… I wasn’t great at it, but i enjoyed it. Fast forward 10 years later and here i am! Trying to switch careers, after some deep personal consideration. Trying to tackle programming first, then will begin to develop other skillsets needed to become a successful game dev.
Anyone have any cool stories or tips?Hey! Game dev is great!
I think you can kind of tier your process. A) do you need to get a job fast in programming? B) What kind of indie companies are you into? C) Do you want to try to have synergy with the theater skills, or do you have a specific set of skills you want to develop?
some general ideas:


try to find previous job listings in those companies and see what is in demand, search reddit for some ideas as well (it’s very informative). The skill sets that jump out at you are the ones you want to be focusing on first.


Great lighting is crucial in games, you can probably see how you can apply your skills in unity with lighting (if you’re interested in 3d).


there are great resources out there (like the CS50 intro to game design series). Just keep your ears to the ground and start organizing them.


the platform you want to work on is also going to affect what kind of language you’ll want to learn first. Do you want to do mobile (if so, iOS?), browser games, computer, VR, AR? Some of these require more proficiency in one language type than another.


Even with very basic programming knowledge, you can already start doing card and text-concept games (towers of hanoi!). As you pick up skills, if you keep doing micro projects not only will it help you know things better, but it doubles as foundational portfolio pieces.

I would say to ignore paying jobs, what you need is experience. Without the experience you won’t get paid, the best you can hope for is an internship.
The best thing you can do is look at Kickstarter, focus on the video game section, and see who is looking for a sponsored tier. I did this for QA, I sponsored a game and was allowed to be an Alpha Tester for Woolfe. I’m not focused on video game testing, but it was a cool experience and my name is in the credits.
Unfortunately, this kind of game/project is very susceptible to issues. In my case, the company had a lot of problems, the game was delayed, and the experience wasn’t the best. Overall, bad project management. The game was still released but not as originally intended, I still got what I wanted out of it.
If nobody has a tier where you can be a developer, you are more likely to get an internship in one of those projects. No, you won’t get paid but what you need right now is experience. You’ve never worked in that environment, you don’t know what it’s like. You need this experience to really decide if you like it or not. What kind of experience you have (positive or negative) will depend on the company you work with. I say this because there are several reports of game developers being “abused” by the larger corporate entities; long working hours, tight deadlines, and a high risk of losing the job if they don’t deliver.
The other thing to consider is that if you manage to score an internship with someone, there is a very high chance you’re going to have to use your own equipment for development as you will most likely be working remotely. Good gaming systems are expensive, so are the systems used to develop them. Do you own said system at the moment? If you want to be flexible, it will have to be a laptop which means it’ll be even more expensive. Yes, system requirements to develop an iOS game are less than to develop a PS5 game but trying to get by with a cheaper system will lead to more expenses down the road (I’ve been there, I know).Thankfully I have lots of time ahead of me that I will be dedicating towards developing all these skills. Just taking a few hours everyday at least. Ironically I am ignorant to what all goes into lighting for 3d environments, or any game in general, but I’ve been curious… now thinking about looking into how I can apply what skills I already possess. Thanks for that idea!
I’ll be trying to work with either Unity or Godot Engine to start actually building games. On Codecademy to obviously develop those programming skills, as I hope I’d find other ways to apply them once I got them (perhaps something like web development). This is definitely a career transition period. So I’m starting with JavaScript (and actually the game design course Codecademy offers), and then will be learning C#.

Khan academy has a cool set of videos that they do in collaboration with Pixar, check them out if you have the time. They might be too simple for you, or they might be interesting!That’s all some very insightful advice, I appreciate it. My goal is to start my own indie game studio (either solo or with a couple other people), however, I see the value in trying to at least get an internship somewhere for the experience. I also have realistic expectations, and am not trying to create the next big thing lol.
The Kickstarter idea is interesting to me… but do you need to financially back the projects in order to reach that tier? Shoot sounds like a good business model for me to follow 
As far as equipment, I’m rocking a macbook pro at the moment, and hope to get some PC in the near future in addition to what I’m workin with.Yes they are great! Been doing their Intro to JS course, but did look at the pixar course. Best to consider me as a “child” with no experience, so anything helps! (Not that khan academy is just for kids lol)Yes, with Kickstarter projects you have to pay them, but you’re paying for the product itself. Depending on the project, they will let you be part of it. In my case, as an alpha tester. If no projects have an option for a developer, you can still contact them and ask if they will let you be an intern. It’s not crazy expensive, I paid $100 for the level that had what I was looking for and took for what it was: a learning opportunity to expand my skills that can land me a better job.
A Macbook Pro is a good start, but it can still have limitations. My Macbook Pro has 16GB of RAM and it’s not enough… should have spent the extra money for the 32GB model. While a Windows laptop with the same specs can be found cheaper, you have to deal with Windows…Almost forgot, the best bang for your buck is to spend the money on a Windows laptop with very good specs (cheaper than a maxed out Macbook Pro), then delete Windows and run your favorite Linux distro. Best of both worlds."
648,Chrome JavaScript timer throttling: Google’s tests show it saves up to 2 hours’ battery life,Tips and Resources,0,140,"I came across this article and thought it was worth sharing for all the aspiring (and current) web devs here!

“When enabled, wake-ups from DOM Timers are limited to one per minute in a page that has been hidden for five minutes,” Google’s Chromium developers note.
“We used Devtools to inspect the work done by popular sites in the background. We found that a lot of work was done from JavaScript timers. Furthermore, we found that the work done from these JavaScript timers was often not valuable to the user when the page was backgrounded (eg checking if scroll position changed, reporting logs, analyzing interactions with ads).”
“At the median, throttling JavaScript timers aggressively extends the battery life by almost two hours (28%) for a user with many background tabs, when the foreground tab is about:blank,” the Chromium team writes.

That’s a huge difference! I’d love to hear from any of you guys that have experience with Javascript DOM Timers and in what situations you use them.
Also, if you want to try it yourself:

To test the JavaScript timing throttling feature, users can download the current Chrome from the Canary developer channel and type into the address bar ‘chrome://flags’ and then either search ‘JavaScript’ or type in ‘chrome://flags/#intensive-wake-up-throttling’. This experiment setting will throttle JavaScript timers in the background.

Enjoy the video, and happy coding! Java is a language like C++ right. And JavaScript is a language used for Web Development.- I am asking this as I cannot watch YouTube videos on my computer.They are both programming languages, but the guys that came up with JavaScript wanted to give their new language a name easy to recognize. At the time Java was all the rage, so they went with JavaScript as a way to get free marketing!

650,What was your win this week?,Random,21,309,"What was your win this week? It can be coding-related or not!

Did you learn something new?
Did you help someone else with a problem?
Did you ace a technical evaluation?

Excited to hear about everyone’s wins! A mix of things! Finished a massive project in work, which was something I was literally learning as I was making it, which was really cool. I also got put forward for a promotion, which is extra cool given today is my 6 month anniversary of getting my current job!
In coding news, I also finally got around to learning a bit more CSS, which was the main place I was lacking in front-end development, so I’ve been enjoying learning a bit more about good styling.I have a 20-day coding streak!
AND, I’m 50% of the way through the Data Science Path. I am going over things that I’ve learned in the past and can’t wait to get to the Machine Learning etc. portions of the course. For now, I will concentrate on where I am. There’s no rush in learning. 
It’s something and I’ll take it. Excellent!! That’s great about the promotion.
CSS I used to dislike but now I’ve come to enjoy it… all the best marketing can’t overcome a badly styled page!I got a job that doesn’t require me to know javaScript. This is important because I don’t think I’m ever going to learn javaScript or I will be old enough to retire by the time I do.Completely unrelated to code, again, this week.
A friend has challenged me to learn a Paul Gilbert track on the bass. I’m not the most technically proficient player - haven’t been playing bass for that long - so I’m counting it as a win that I got a handle on the first 2:14 (before a very fast, very cool lick comes in) pretty quickly. It’s about half the song, so not bad for the first few attempts.
Not hugely familiar with Gilbert’s solo work, I know of him more because of his time with Mr Big and Racer X. Still, the track is pretty cool. You can listen to it on YouTube 1, if you’re interested.This week I drew a lot of stuff. Most of them are sketches, but I enjoyed making them like you have no idea  I did finish one illustration though, and I’m very proud of it 
In general, my art got much better and I had a great time. That’s a win, right? That’s a win!
That’s cool!
I think it’s good balance to have a musical outlet; learn to play an instrument.
Every time I think I know music, I realize that there are so many bands/musicians that I don’t know.

 lisalisaj:

From listening to him I’m hearing a Rush influence. (?)


I’m fairly sure that he’s quoted Alex Lifeson as one of many guitarists who influenced him, but tbh I think Rush influenced a lot of people…I saw Rush once, eons ago on NYE at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit. Primus opened for them. It was an excellent show. (From what I can remember. Haha)Finished my first basic flask model blog (first foray into flask)! This coming week I’ll be practicing on unit testing, deploying it, and sharpening up the CSS and changing its functionality for scenarios that I’ll probably run into with colleagues (music performance, music education).
Cloud services like linode and AWS I’ve been largely ignorant about. So if anybody knows good primers on those let me know 
It’s also the second week in a row I’ve seen actual friends in person since the pandemic started. It’s not back to normal… but I’ll take it!I’m on a 8 day streak on the DS path.  
I’m looking forward to getting pass the SQL material and onto the Python material.Ha, I totally understand you on that. I have a love/hate relationship w/SQL.
It’s my nemesis. hahaha.I think AWS has (free?) classes on how to use AWS. You know, similar to how Google has free classes on how to use Big Query or Analytics.
I haven’t seen my friends at all b/c that requires a subway ride. I’m still a little leery about that. I mean, we talk, email, text all the time, so, I will take that for the time being.
I also usually play in a spring softball league here in the city and that’s been xld, or, PPD. I miss it & goofing around with my friends. I know I’ll see them soon. (hopefully).   I don’t hate it - do love it.  It’s just that I’ve spent a great portion of my career working with Oracle SQL (atleast 10,000 hours) typing the word select.  I’m patiently working thru it to learn about the subtle differences in SQLite.“Oracle SQL (atleast 10,000 hours)”          Can you imagine a SQL statement hundreds of lines long haha. blank stare.

651,Weekly Poll for July 6,Random,11,160,"
 Welcome to Our Weekly Poll 

Learning to code can be like learning a language.  There is learning the structure and then working with the individual words to build sentences.
   How many languages do you speak and write?
 1 2 3 4+15votersVotes are public.Vote now! Results will be shown on vote.
Feel free to comment below. 
I like this analogy.
It works on many levels. I’ve studied both french and mandarin for 2 years but I’ll always understand italian and portuguese quicker without having studied them (because spanish is my native language). That being said, I can’t write or formulate sentences in italian/portguese like I can in french or mandarin.
And then there’s the aspect of maintaining proficiency when you’re outside of the culture of a language. I have friends that have nearly completely lost their spanish (particularly their reading/writing). So to maintain a native language strong enough outside its context, there has to be some deliberateness.Ich verstehe ein bisschen Deutsch.
Not enough for it to be of much practical use, mind. I can comprehend German to a greater extent than I can translate from English into German… but I think that’s just because I spend more time reading it than I do speaking it…I’ve had to sit through hours of Beethoven rehearsals not understanding a lick of German… I know very basic French. Enough to get around Paris the couple times I went. Maybe.  I think I can read it a little better than if I hear it (if that makes sense?) I always forget the verb conjugations. I have tried to learn Italian but I stopped for some reason. I def need to learn more languages.Shikamu! Habari gani?
I can make enough conversation for day-to-day use, and of course English. I am learning French though the French grammar always trips me up.


Q: Do you know the language I started with?
A: Swahili!
Spanish is my native language, I learned English a while ago in order to be able to make some friends online (lol) and started learning French a year ago. Like @toastedpitabread said, it was relatively easy because Spanish is my native language 
I love comparing learning to code (and coding concepts as well) to real life stuff, it makes it easier to get the hang of it.Thanks for sharing.  That’s Interesting you have Mandarin in the mix.  I think it goes to show that languages with have similarities make it easier to learn intuitively.  While other languages, really force you to learn the structure before you can really formulate a conversation.
You are definitely correct, one has to make a deliberate effort to maintain that native language proficiency.Maybe, you can read out loud .  I have noticed that just reading another language isn’t enough and hearing yourself pronounce the words makes quite the difference.Of course, I had to Google it.  I would have never guessed.  Hujambo!
Yes, there’s a lot of memorizing grammar rules in French.I know a little Spanish and a little German, but would feel like a total fool trying to actually communicate in either. I have always had great admiration for those who can communicate in multiple languages especially those who can communicate effectively in English when it isn’t their first language. I’ve seen many young children translate English to Spanish for their parents/grandparents. It completely amazes me that people so young can be fluent in both.You have to seize opportunities to practice your Spanish and German "
652,Making a switch from HVAC Design Engineer to Software Engineer,Random,1,148,"Hello everyone!
I decided that after 5 years being a HVAC design engineer I knew that this job / life would not cut it for me anymore and I could not see myself in the next 10 years doing that so I decided to make the switch and  learn coding.
I am only in my 2nd week, but in just this short time I know that this is something I want to pursue and am actually excited to learn after working a full day. I am obviously nervous because its a complete switch in careers but this is not stopping me whatsoever.
If anyone has similar stories that would be greatly appreciated and it would show me that what I am doing is achievable.I just started learning some programming myself in hopes of becoming a self-starting game dev. I’m coming from theater/entertainment as a lighting tech. With the economic shutdown(s) here in the US, my industry has come to a halt, and who knows for how long. Work won’t be the same for a long time. So I’ve made the decision to follow this interest. Wish I decided this a few months ago, I could have taken more advantage of the free time. So far so good, lots to learn."

654,Making a huge career switch,Corner Bar,7,238,"good morning everyone.
small intro: had been very interested in PCs since childhood. Put my own desktop together, organize LAN parties, explore programs, etc … but not followed ICT at school because I thought I was “too stupid”. Now I’m in my early 30’s and I really regret it, so …
In belgium we have the luxury, when your unemployed, you can follow free lessons for “bottleneck profession” (don’t know if that’s the right translation) and there are several in the ICT sector
My first lesson will start soon: basic ICT development course that will take 10 weeks.
meanwhile already learned a lot @ home, via different website (which this one is the best of course;))
first I wanted to do something with graphics  but it is not a “bottleneck profession” so I learned to code at home and am completely crazy about it, but after those 10 weeks I have to choose between:

.net developer with c # more info 2

Java developer more info

php developer more info


so the choices are quite limited, as I see it now I would like to grow into a software developer which choice do I make the best? all tips are welcome of course.
thanksHello @taillieyourservice! I’m not a professional at all, but I can give a few insights into those languages-having learnt on CC two, and read about Java.
C#:
This is a heavily object oriented language (meaning it uses classes-or objects-as the heart of it; how it runs, etc), C# is statically typed (meaning you must declare the type of variable, function return type, etc explicitly), and is mostly used by Microsoft. But this is not new. When I learnt it, I found quite interesting-it certainly helped me learn some features of OOP, but it was a little verbose (but coming from Python, it would!) I mostly enjoyed learning it, though.
Java:
I haven’t done much Java, but from what I’ve read it seems similar-ish to C#, although there are of course differences. This 1 article explains nicely the difference between C# and Java.
PHP:
I think this is used more for backend website development that app dev. When I learnt it-although I’m only a beginner with it-I enjoyed it, and found it less verbose and easier to pick up than C#. It is dynamically typed-you don’t have to explicitly state the type of variable-and is also an OOP language.  Here 1 is an article giving pros/cons to PHP.
If you had a little while before you have to decide, you could take a small bit of the CodeCademy course on each language, and see which one you prefer.
@SuperUsers, do you have any more input?
Happy coding!Morning,
Look for dev jobs in Flanders, see what language comes up the most.
I think you can’t really go wrong with either three, although Java is probably still the most popular out there (for the big, corporate type companies, that is). Then again it might depend what your end goal is, as software development encompasses quite a few different areas of expertise.
If your primary goal right now is employment, then that’s what I’d do.
The great thing is that after learning either one of these languages, the next one will be much easier to pick up, should you decide to pivot toward something slightly different.Like others have written, I’d look up at local listings as well to get an idea of things they ask for.
Sometimes the language you like coding in the most is not going to have the type of job you like the most, and sometimes some jobs that interest you will ask for skills that you’re less interested now.
It depends on you personality studying. I actually find that if I like the language, I don’t mind if the job market it aims for is a little tedious.
Plan That being said having a plan is important (short, middle, long term). If you like graphics you can/should start studying for that now (even if only half an hour a day). Not only will it give you an idea if you like it or not, but it’ll also help you be better positioned to transition once you’re more settled in your job. I know there’s tons of great tutorials out there for blender and things like that so it’s definitely there for the taking. You can get a surprising amount done by this incremental approach over a period of time.
In terms of C#/Java/PHP my personal preference would go to Java, but only because I’m not a huge fan of windows. C# itself I really like as well (but they’re similar languages on a technical level). PHP is interesting if you’re into web stuff. Knowing PHP won’t really help you know C# or Java (but C#/Java have a lot of interchangeable concepts between themselves).
The internet has a ton of great learning material so take advantage: IRC, discord, youtube, reddit, scribd, podcasts, newsletters, and real books are all legitimate ways to learn and have your ears to the ground in the field. Don’t forget networking, people you already know fit into the picture too (they might not work directly in computers, but many will probably have potential needs for applications and web services relevant to what they do).
Hope this helps a bit.Thanks for the feedback @codeneutrino @ghostlovescore & @toastedpitabread.
I just looked at job offers in my area. I already know more about that, but what I see now is that there are many companies looking for bachelor’s or master’s degree and experience … there’s a lot of IT support , isn’t that mostly a “pigeon loft?” (lol we call it that way if i translate it letterly,) don’t want to disrespect anybody. what i want to say is, how i see it, that they easily switch employez for this job…
=true or =false? 
gonna make a list with everythinks that interest me as job because there are many differents
greetzDegrees in that particular field are often useful but not always necessary if you qualify yourself properly (but it depends on the job). Usually when they put a list of qualifications they want a good amount of those, but it’s a general wish list.
Once you find the ones that interest you, I’d try to find written accounts of people that successfully get entry level without a degree and ask them or take notes on how they pulled it off. (reddit has a few of those)Hi @taillieyourservice,
Have you read through the StackOverflow 2020 Developer Survey results? They had 65,000 software developers for 186 countries answer their annual survey. It might be helpful to see what’s relevant  out there as far as developer profiles, types of work, technologies used.
it’s here:

Yeah, seems weird that the explainer text is Py3 but the interpreter behind the scenes is Py2.x
I’ll ask about it. I noticed that too! Is this section supposed to be in python3? I don’t remember it being part of the learn Python3 course or is it a case of previous lessons used python3 but this one forces you to use 2.7?It’s part of the Data Science path. The 2.7 solution works. I was just pointing it out for consistency bc the instructions are in Py3.
And when I plug the code into Colab, I get an error…bc it’s 2.7.I’ve run trhough these lessons but not the full path so I wasn’t sure what you meant but then the next page had print(len(""Hello, world!"")) on it so it does seem a little scattered (apologies if that’s not what you meant). Perhaps having the import statement for the print function would make it more obvious the interpeter is running python2."

There’s been several posts reporting this issue so far, I think it’s something to do with that specific lesson not working correctly. You can either complete the whole exercise without the check marks, and then “View Solution” and compare your code to theirs, or you can wait until there’s been a fix, unfortunately I’ve not found another way around it so far.
I’d recommend copying the code for index.html and style.css into files for VS code, and then comparing your completed exercise in VS Code to their solution given by “View Solution”. This also automatically marks all of the checkboxes as completed, allowing you to continue.Thank you.

However, I was really good at programming (achieving the highest Mark in class for the programming module at university).
Is it possible for me to get a job a tech related job, or apprenticeship? If not, are there any other career paths I could take?You should build a portfolio!  Don’t worry about building projects for others or for pay at first, just make some projects that you’d enjoy making.  Some very common (maybe cliché?) examples are building a Twitter clone and making a tip calculator.  Throw it all up on github.  Make a personal website (it doesn’t have to be super-beautiful) that can showcase your work.  This is an example from a Codecademy software engineer (who was himself self-taught): https://jonsamp.dev/ 20
You need to be able to show what you’ve built with code and speak as to how you’ve built it in order to be able to make progress in your career.  Certificates and things can help, but ultimately employers only care about what you’ve built and how.
It’s a long journey, but making that portfolio of projects is an inevitable step in your journey if you want to pursue this track seriously.Thank you! I do have a few projects, I just haven’t uploaded them anywhere yet. I did create a website a while ago which I have not done anything with - so I guess I could upload my projects there.
The problem I am having right now is that I have no job, which is a bit of an issue. It will take a while for me to build up a proper portfolio, so I am not entirely sure what I should be doing right now to make some money.Moving to a developer career track takes time, and given that you don’t have a job right now I’m sure that time is of the essence.  It will also take time for you to build your skills and experience up to the point where freelance development work is enough to pay the bills.
You could aim to move into a developer-adjacent role, something like QA or another type of IT role for example, which are A) a perfectly good career path in its own right B) a path with relatively fewer barriers to entry at the lowest levels C) a really good way to build up experience with code if a developer job is your final objective.Thanks for the advice!
I recently applied to an IT job with RBS, spent weeks going through all the tests, and then completely failed the numeracy test despite days and days of practice. Confidence is at an all time low right now.
Are there IT companies/roles that wouldn’t require a numeracy test?I got my first software engineer job just after I graduated from my university. I accepted that role following teaching myself to code using freecodecamp. I progressed well and became the manager in a top reputed company over that time. I earned well and got good benefits. It made me think much more, where I decided to start my own business. Now I run a software company in Kansas where I can motivate many other developers. In order to cut costs and focus more on the business development and expansion I’m mostly dependent on IT Outsourcing practice. I have hired a software development outsourcing team to outsource my development tasks.
I was very well prepared for all the hurdles as I had a passion of coding and running a business of my own. I feel that if you genuinely want to be a software developer, or anything for that matter, only hard work and the dedication to do it will help you to achieve it."

What is the best coding language for beginner?I start with Python.  Its code is easy to comprehend.PYTHON.
It’s just like English Language. Very Easy.
Even if you are new (you know nothing about coding) still you will be able to understand it easily.
Just keep practicing and don’t give up easily.I’d actually recommend HTML & CSS, because its a nice way to start off your coding and in my opinion, its the first step in full stack dev. You build your website and style it and then you add your login/sign-up forms which can be done with the back end languages.
But honestly, it depends on what you’re trying to do with programming.

What is the best coding language for beginner?


I started with Python, and it’s going pretty well. I like the way it’s versatile and you can use it in several different ways. I also started with HTML & CSS, (yes, three things at the same time…) and I haven’t really used that in any of my own projects so far… I agree with @stevencopeland, it really REALLY depends on what you want to do with your coding skills. Codecademy has an awesome quiz you can take to help you decide. 
Well wishes on your coding journey!I started my Computer Programming students at the beginning of the school year with C++ for foundation, moved to Java for comparison, now on to Python to show growth, understanding and comparisons within multiple languages. My web classes were using HTML outside of Codecademy and will begin using HTML soon. They will then move to CSS and then Javascript. Having to flip the classroom has created a shift in learning strategies and styles.I am interested in Data analytics for marketing. I started with R yesterday and its going good, however a colleague suggested I take up Python instead. Should I switch?I will start also with Python.
Hi,
I am not seeing the recording.the record did not work in my phone browserI am struggling understanding class & objects even though i have finished the python3  course.
What are some other ways to improve my understanding on that particular topic?
Do I just spam exercises on that certain topic?Try with looking at the cheatsheets and figure out what you understand and what not. It’s easier and faster instead of just spam all the courses again.Hi, The link for the recording isn’t right.Continuing the discussion from Getting Started: How to get the most out of Codecademy:
hey i starded to learn coding about a week ago and began with javascript do u think it is a good decision?Well, considering that JavaScript is heavily used for front-end development, and can be used on the back-end too, as well as being in high demand right now… I’d say that, yes, it’s a pretty wise choice.I think you should start by learning HTML & CSS then python & then go ahead.
I agree with @stevencopeland too.I’ve included the correct link to the recorded webcast   Sorry about that! @a-r-s @net2620295945 @angel-1989
Watch the recording here! 13Im gonna start with html, css and javascript. But it actually depends. If you are more into web designing start with html and css. If you wanna be a game developer, maybe start with JavaScript. If you want to be a data scientist, go with python:)I started with Python and then JavaScript. Good question, @byte0886837556!"

                doing cd without any arguments will take your to your home directory. Which means you are not in the right directory to complete the exercise. You should be in your personal-website directory as pointed out by @thepitycoder

You will first need to create a local git repository:
git init
@stetim94
I tryed that:无标题911×214 7.45 KBBut you get a different error now? So you are a step further.
now it says: remote origin already existed. So you have already completed this @stetim94
Yes, I should have completed this, but codecademy doesn’t give me the check:无标题1366×626 38.5 KByou remove the remote:
git remote remove origin

or something like that, and try again.I tryed that also:无标题1366×626 40.7 KByou are sure that remove works too? The hint says to use rm (i do not know these commands from the top of my head, that is why documentation exists)
you could verify no remote has been setup using:
git remote -v

have pressed enter after typing the command? I would expect to see a new $ at the next line.@stetim94
I did get a $image1366×768 71.3 KB@stetim94 ?
Are you there?you have walked through all the steps now, it seems. Not sure what else the problem can be. There now doesn’t seem to be a remote, so now adding a remote should go fine.
otherwise, you should make a bug report.@stetim94
So I do a bug report?image1366×768 67.7 KBI think that is a good idea.Hey both.
@renbozhang can you please check the output of the pwd command in the terminal? I am expecting that you’ll get this:
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/daw

The reason that you’re unable to complete the git remote add origin command is because the daw directory is not a Git repository.
Exercise #3 (Initialize Your Repo) has you change into the personal-website directory and initialize a repo there (with git init), however this does not appear to persist when you move to Exercise #4 (Add the Remote).
If you cd into the personal-website directory, and then try and add the remote, everything should work (presuming that you correctly initialized it as a repo in the previous exercise).
(I’m also going to move this to the Bug Reporting category, and will log it with CC.)@thepitycoder
This is what I get:image1366×768 83.5 KB
I still get a cross instead of a check.doing cd without any arguments will take your to your home directory. Which means you are not in the right directory to complete the exercise.

También me gustaría saber cuando estarán de nuevo los cursos en español?When I select “Español” option, everything continues in English i can’t read espanol league.Desafortunadamente, los cursos en español fueron eliminados debido a la actualización de la plataforma Codecademy con el fin de mejorar los cursos existentes y agregar otros nuevos.
Debido a ello, el esfuerzo de mantener cursos en Español no estaba siendo rentable y además acarrea la contratación de personal para su mantenimiento tanto en contenido como en funcionalidad.
De igual manera, es mejor aprender a programar en inglés, ya que la mayoría de las documentaciones están disponibles en dicha habla, sin contar las millones de preguntas y respuestas en sitios como StackOverflow.
Que pasen buen día. Siento disentir. Es muy recomendable conocer el inglés para las documentaciones y plataformas de ayuda, como bien dices, pero de ahí a renunciar a nuestro propio idioma para el aprendizaje…largo camino hay.
Que tengas un gran día Totalmente de acuerdo, yo aprendí a programar antes de que ser fluido en inglés. Tambien hay muchisima documetación en chino mandarin, pero no todos estamos aprendiendo madarin no?
I’m totally agree, I’ve learnt coding before been fluent in English. There are also many documentation on chinese mandarin but we aren’t learning mandarin? Aren’t we?.
What will happen with the basic coding courses for not dev people?Me parece un grave error no ofrecer los cursos en español también, siendo esta la segunda lengua más hablada en el mundo luego del inglés. Personalmente cuento con un muy buen nivel de inglés, pero el aprendizaje no se deja de volver cuesta arriba haciéndolo en otro lenguaje que no es nativo para nosotros. Me parece también que si el objetivo de este sitio es de cierta manera la “inclusión”, de esta manera se está dejando a un gran número de personas fuera, ya que no todo el mundo sabe inglés.
Una lástima.
Saludos.


 kingdarboja:

Realmente no hace falta que tenga contenido o funcionalidad diferente al del curso en inglés. Todo lo que tienen que hacer es meter en algún traductor las instrucciones de cada ejercicio, verificar que la traducción tenga sentido para lo que se quiere expresar y quizá también cambiar el nombre de algunas funciones (aunque esto como un mero agregado)Estoy de acuerdo contigo Nico.
Es un error no traducir a otros idiomas, es cierto que requiere personal y mas tiempo pero ¿el resto de personas que no tienen la capacidad de aprender otro idioma entonces no pueden aprender a programar? Es simple racismo. Siempre ha sido asi.
Pongo otro Ejemplo:
¿Porque cuando un Americano viene a Suramerica y solicita Visa (para lo que sea) no lo obligan a APRENDER HABLAR BIEN ESPAÑOL?
Ah pero uno va a Estados Unidos y quiere Visa y pasas años si es que logras tener Visa y te obligan HABLAR, LEER, ESCRIBIR PERFECTO EL INGLES.
Eso es injusticaHonestamente, me parece una decisión prágmatica en el sentido de que no estan intentando de esmerarse (náda más hacer su negocio).
Obviamente, yo coincido que lo realmente prágmatico es ser global pero eso un valor que empresas no estan requeridas a tener. Lamentablemente como hispanxs estamos muy atrasadxs con el tema de documentación y ese es el.punto clave.
Lo que sería un proyecto extremademente interesante es usar Machine Learning para traducir los tomos de documentación existentes (con la ayuda de traductores humanos técnicos).

They should be able to tell you the full information.Hey @wickdw8yz!
Do you mean the length of time it takes to complete each course? Because that is mentioned beneath that stat bar on each course:

image.png1366×670 59.3 KB

Tell me if I’m misunderstanding though@stevencopeland No. you have the idea right. I know it says those time frames in the course overview. I’m wondering mainly on the courses that says weeks, like 10 weeks, 20 weeks; how is the time frame calculated. Is it if people do 8 hours a day for 5 days a week? Or, closer to 2hrs a day for 10 or 20 weeks? So, a 40 hour course takes 40 hours, but how many days does it take the average person to complete it.
I don’t work, so if the Computer Science Course is 20 weeks, which I’m not sure of, I can work on it for 8-10 hours a day.@stevencopeland here is an example:



I don't know, but to be reasonable its probably a hour or two a day is what I'd think.Hi all—the most scientific answer that we can provide is that it depends. On several factors, really.

The speed at which you read
How many attempts before a correct answer
The rate of project completion
And more variables, of course

You can imagine that we’d love to give a more precise length! I hope you can understand why it’s not quite possible right now, though.I am building a website named Curtains Expert 4, can anyone here help me with some of my CSS queries?Please create a topic in the relevant category with information then someone can help you.
https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/community/getting-started 9Hi! I’m interested in this as well.

675,Codecademy vs Pearson Revel/Online Textbooks,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",0,133,"Hey everyone!
I have been using Codecademy Pro under the Student Scholarship, which has really given me a strong foundation in understanding the basics of programming. Although there is much to learn, I feel as though I have the tools to face challenges more than before.
Alternatively, I just started a minor in Computer Science at my university, where the learning is similarly all online nowadays. I think the contrast between the platform Pearson Revel and Codecademy is very interesting. The course I am taking through university is Intro to Java, which covers most of the same concepts as Codecademy’s course.
I find that Pearson Revel talks about coding so much that it makes some of the concepts more confusing than they actually are. Not only that, but they present each concept on a long scrolling page that has scary looking code excerpts that are supposed to be useful. Not saying this platform is awful, but as someone still relatively new to Computer Science, I think the difference is large.
Has anyone else noticed similar comparisons between Codecademy/university curriculum and platforms?
Thanks!"

677,[Blog] 48 hours of hacking and inspiration with Pursuit,Community,1,82,"2083×875
At Codecademy, we believe that learning to code is about more than just
picking up a new skill. It's about transforming ourselves, our communities,
and the world around us.
That's why we were proud to sponsor a virtual class hackathon with Pursuit 1,
a Queens-based organization that trains adults from under-represented backgrounds
to become software engineers. In their words, ""Pursuit creates transformation
where it's needed most.""
Pursuit believes that everyone should have the opportunity to achieve
the American Dream regardless of gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background.
Pursuit Fellows are 70% Black or Latinx, 40% are immigrants, and the majority
have been public assistance recipients. On average, they increase their
average salaries from $18,000 to over $85,000. The hackathon participants
started the program nine months ago with little to no coding knowledge.
They give up their evenings and weekends in order to learn, while also
holding down full-time jobs and raising families — in the middle of a global
pandemic!
Codecademy contributed prize money and Pro subscriptions to the hackathon,
but more importantly, we contributed our people. People from our engineering,
product, curriculum, and business development teams volunteered the weekend
working with Pursuit Fellows as technical mentors and judges.
We had the honor to work closely with incredibly smart, creative, and
hard-working Fellows as they pushed themselves to learn new things and
achieve more than they believed they could. After 48 hours of hacking,
we celebrated with a virtual demo night, which you can watch here:
The Fellows showcased apps that addressed important real-world problems:
staying informed about COVID-19, supporting reopening restaurants, surfacing
online reviews about discriminatory businesses, or just finding new music
to listen to while you're stuck at home.
One of the team’s favorite moments from the hackathon happened when the
judges left the Zoom room to deliberate. The Fellows unmuted themselves
for a Q&A with the session hosts and remote viewers. They shared honest
and moving stories about their hackathon experiences: their fears and frustrations,
their struggles, the joys of seeing something finally work, and the pride
they felt in how much they'd learned and achieved. Many tears of joy were
shed.
Codecademy team members have been closely involved with Pursuit for a
couple of years now, helping with everything from hackathons to capstone
projects to whiteboard practice and workshops on technical skills. We're
excited to continue our partnership with Pursuit and we can't wait to see
the impact the Fellows have on the tech industry!

@mathink3r - I ran into the same issue, very similar code. I read and re-read the Implement task (#25) and Step 6 in there is the issue.


Still within the loop, set the value at  originalValue  on  invertedObject  to be the current key.


invertedObject inside the for … in loop is adding a key/value pair to the empty invertedObject outside the for … in loop. So poor step 6 wording aside, invertedObject inside the for … in loop should be:
invertedObject = {originalValue: obj};if you go to the console doing
var object = { ‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 2, ‘c’: 1 };
_.invert(object);
you should get { ‘1’: ‘c’, ‘2’: ‘b’ }
but in this way you don’t get it@systemrunner14485 - When you read through Tasks associated with the _.invert() method (23, 24 & 25), it states that you are swapping the key and value for each key/value pair. You are not inverting the object. So in your example:

var object = { ‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 2, ‘c’: 1 };

should output: {1: ‘a’, 2: ‘b’ 1: ‘c’}. Thats the way I approached it and it passed the test.this post helped me a lot. Thanks!


 michael3rown:

You are not inverting the object.


Well, actually that’s exactly what we are doing. The inverse of 4 is 1 over 4 and the inverse of that is 4. The inverse of key: value is value: key and of course the inverse of that is key: value, again.
The member does correctly show the inverse, but also shows a change in order which is non-applicable (trivial) since objects are not ordered to begin with.Hi,
I’m having the same problem. Hope hijacking this thread isn’t an issue.
I’m doing the invert iteration and even though I’ve copied the code exactly as the guide, I’m still getting invalid code running.
This is my code -

This is the instructor code -
Actually, I can’t attach it here because new users can’t attach more than 1 image. The code is on this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&v=av5JiKektzE 2 at the 24 minute mark.
Please help!new_obj[newValue] = key;

When assigning directly with = new_obj doesn’t get updated, but replaced. The above updates the object.That’s exactly what I thought!!
But in the tutorial it shows this -

I’m still now sure what I’m doing wrong…The line,
    invertedObject = {originalValue: key}

assigns a single object, rather than updating it (add another key:value pair).
const _ = {
    invert(object) {
        let invertedObject = {};
        for (let key in object) {
            let originalValue = object[key];
            invertedObject[originalValue] = key;
        }
        return invertedObject;
    }
}

obj = {1:'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
_.invert(obj)
// {one: ""1"", two: ""2"", three: ""3""}
Okay, thanks mtf! Your code works.
My issue is that in the instructors code, that works, she uses the line



 mtf:

invertedObject = {originalValue: key}


and the node test works. When I do it, it does not work.
I instead use

invertedObject[originalValue] = key;

This works fine. I just can’t wrap my mind over why something was working for her and not me!!
Btw, thank you for your contribution otherwise. As I’ve been on this journey of learning, I find your answers in many FAQ’s and they’ve been really helpful. Also your quick response time  Blessings MTF.I had a similar problem to mustu5.
The node test passed but when I tested the code separately to see how it worked it only inverted and displayed the last key/value pair in the console.
Thanks for your help mtf!We’ll need to see your code, please."

682,[Blog] Introducing Learn A-Frame: A VR course you can take… in VR!,Community,1,153,"2000×840
Virtual reality is alive and well, which is why we’re beyond excited to
introduce you to our newest course — Learn A-Frame 2.
“We worked closely with the A-Frame team to
design an introductory VR course that’s magical, state of the art, and
breathtaking,” says Sonny, the Codecademy curriculum developer behind this
course.
Recommended to developers, designers, and non-technical creatives alike,
Learn A-Frame can be taken the usual way, using a computer. Or, you can
experience the course using a VR headset and keyboard. A VR course in VR!
Pretty meta, right?
1728×1118
A look inside Learn A-Frame
Check out the video demo below for a look inside the course with Sonny.
Then, read on for a Q&A with Sonny to learn more about Learn A-Frame.
We’ll also share a sneak peek at some of the Pro-exclusive projects found
within the course.
We spoke with Sonny to learn more about the course, who it’s designed
for, and what you can expect. Check out the interview below.
Q: Who is the Learn A-Frame course right for?
This course is for beginner or seasoned developers and designers who are
interested in learning about VR development, as well as for non-technical
creatives who want to prototype something in VR.
The only prerequisite for this course is an understanding of HTML syntax.
Bonus points if you have some JavaScript knowledge, too.
Q: What skills will I take away when I’m finished with this course?
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build virtual scenes for
your friends and families to explore, whether they’re using a VR headset
or a browser.
Q: What makes this course special?
This is Codecademy's first VR course — and that’s not all. One of the
neat things about this course is that you can actually take the entire
thing inside of a VR headset. Use an Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S, or HTC
Vive and see the virtual world come to life as you’re coding it.
Pop in and out of VR as you go. Simply go to the Codecademy website within
a VR browser to get started. If you don't have a VR headset you can still
take the course in your regular web browser.

Q: What are the Pro-exclusive features of this course?
In addition to Pro-exclusive quizzes to test your knowledge of the concepts
learned in this course, we’ve also included a collection of Pro projects
that let you apply what you’ve learned to real-world scenarios. Here’s
a sneak preview of what you’ll build in the Learn A-Frame Pro projects.

683,Repl.it - Weekly Challenge #8,Tips and Resources,0,144,"This week’s challenge is brought to you by the guys over at repl.it !
EQUATIONS!
You are to take a alegebraic equation input from the user. Here, you can either take only the coefficients of the terms as input or the entire equation and then solve it!
(YES, write a program to do your homework)
And as for the equation, it should be able to solve up to 2nd degree equations. Any higher than that is entirely up to you! A sample is given below.
User input : (x ** 2) - 6x + 8 = 0
Output : x = [2, 4]

NOTE :  You can give the output in any readable form that you prefer. The variable in the user entered equation will always be  x  unless you decide to only take the coefficients for the input, in which case, it is in your hands.

And as usual, it should all have proper prompts and human readable interactions.
SUBMISSION
For submitting your repls, post them on the repl talk share board 1 and ensure that they contain  #WEEKLY  in their name.

NOTE :  You cannot have multiple weekly challenge submissions but if you want to share multiple ways of achieving the goal, you can make regular posts that don’t contain  #WEEKLY in their name, even  WEEKLY  is fine.

And that’s it for today, code away and have fun replers!

That’s the prompt! What do you guys think? Sounds like fun. As always, feel free to post your solutions down below (and of course, if you are up to it, share them at repl.it as well ) Here is some Q&A from the original post that clarifies some things:

AmazingMech2418 (646)](https://repl.it/@AmazingMech2418 1)
Should it also be able to get any solutions with complex numbers? Also, should it support the methods of notating exponents as  ^  and  **  or just  ** ? Also, should it include trigonometry, exponential functions, logarithms, and rational functions or just linear and quadratic functions?
TheDrone7 (984)

Complex numbers are optional.
It’s up to you but by default I am going to assume it to be  **  so you would need to specify if you want me to type in some other format.
Only linear and quadratic functions are required. Others can be added for bonus but won’t account to your actual score.



Coder100 (2653)](https://repl.it/@Coder100)

Pass/failure is mostly up to you, really."
685,TypeScript A Rising Star? ️,Tips and Resources,5,228,"Ever heard of TypeScript? Microsoft released it 8 years ago and it has grown in popularity non-stop. Developer analyst firm RedMonk latest ranking put TypeScript as the 12th most popular programming language in the world, up from 17th just a year before. They looked at github repositories and Stack Overflow conversations to make the list.
npm developers did a survey of 33,000 developers from 156 countries who use npm: “Overall, 36 percent of npm users are writing TypeScript some or most of the time.”
Have I peaked your interest in TypeScript yet? Did you already know about it? There are lots of resources online to learn about TypeScript like their official website: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html 3
and lots of youtube videos! I’d love to hear what experiences you guys have had with TypeScript, if you are planning on learning it or any warnings for beginners!I’ve heard of TypeScript, and know that it’s related to JavaScript but introduces extra features and bits.
I only really started dabbling with vanilla JavaScript recently, so haven’t actually done anything with TS personally. I’m sure I’ll get to it eventually. I’ve also barely looked at TypeScript. From my very brief look, and possibly sketchy memory, I seem to recall TypeScript allowing programmers to type variables & such, but typing is not required. Once I read that all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript, I quit looking at it. Not sure I see the usefulness unless an organization were to strictly enforce it’s use. Not sure how that’s possible since valid JavaScript code won’t throw errors. Please correct me if I’m wrong, that’s just what I remember from a year or more ago.I believe @joshgoldberg77279673 would be great to expand on why TypeScript is awesome and why it’s worth learning. Or maybe I’m wrong!Hey sorry I just saw this notification! Yes, there are quite a few very good reasons to use TypeScript (and, like any tech, a drawback or two). The main Codecademy site’s codebase was converted to TypeScript in 2019, and we’re working on a TypeScript course for later this year.
It’s technically true that most valid JavaScript syntax is valid TypeScript syntax, but TS adds a lot of intelligence around finding runtime bugs in your code. For example, do you spot the bug here?
let myName = ""irlfede"";
myName.toUppercase();

It’s technically valid JS but TypeScript would tell you that toUpperCase()/toUppercase() is a typo.
TypeScript also lets you define the expected shapes of your variables, class members, function parameters, and so on - which is very useful as your code gets larger over time. If you’re, say, calling a function from an npm package that takes in a complex object as an argument, TypeScript will tell you in your editor what the allowed fields are named & supposed to be, and it’ll yell at you if you get it wrong.
Re enforcing, there are a few strategies you could apply. Projects run by experienced TS devs that start with TS often have very strict usage, but if you’re not particularly TS experienced and/or your project isn’t already converted, there are looser compiler settings that allow less strictly typed code while still giving you most of the benefits. The Webpack codebase, for example, is actually deliberately still written in JavaScript (and last I checked plans on staying that way), but uses TypeScript as an extra layer of safety.
If you’re just getting started with JavaScript, or your project isn’t bigger than a few files, TypeScript might not be a great match for you. It’s got a bit of a learning curve so jumping into it before you’re ready can be painful – and any tech can be hard to learn even when you are ready. But if you’re working on bigger stuff or just want to level up I’d definitely recommend learning it.@irlfede typescript is a super set of JavaScript … and the syntax is really really super strict … you can’t miss a semicolon…  "
686,AI with JavaScript?,Community,6,89,"Is machine learning or AI possible and efficient with JavaScript?Maybe there is very slim change its possible, but its more likely that you will win the lottery.
Javascript is not a suitable language for Machine Learning. If I could choice the language, frameworks and libraries to write an application involving machine learning, JS wouldn’t even feature on the list of choices
use the right tool for the job, don’t try to use a tool for a job is isn’t suitable for.So what would be the appropriate tool for this job?There are dozen blog post covering this question. I would google something like:
which language machine learning
amazing, I found an article where JS was used for Machine Learning. Surprising. Seems people know one language and want to use it for everything.I mean if you are familiar with one language it’s natural to explore its boundaries rather than learning a new language to carry out a task Learning new languages becomes a lot easier after a while. Learning new tools will make you a better developer. It gives you a better understanding of pros and cons of a language, and why certain languages are better fits for certain purposes. Resulting in better maintainable code base in the long run.
JS has just explored its boundaries, its gone far beyond them.Yes this is true, but only to an extent. The further out you get from a strength of a language, the more it feels like reinventing the wheel. It really pays to have the ability to work at least moderately ok in a few that interrelate."
687,Machine Learning Skill Path - Skills required,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,1,113,"Hey there everyone!
I’d just like to point out that when I began the skill path Machine Learning, it seemed that I could get through it just with the Python 3 course. But it feels like it’s actually quite necessary to get to it either through the Data Science Career Path or doing the Analyze Data with Python or Analyze Financial data with Python Skill Paths since the Machine Learning Skill Path relies so much on libraries such as SciPy, Pandas, NumPy and even Matplotlib.
Hope this is helpful to anyone who’s looking to study Machine Learning. And maths! Linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics all help a bunch."
688,Duration of the Computer science Path,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",4,241,"Hello, I want to know how much time it takes to complete the computer science path and Data science by doing it like 2-3 hours daily. ThanksThis is a difficult question to answer because everyone has a different capacity to learn and absorb new concepts. How much background on the material you have before starting also helps (for example, if you have coded before or come from a technical background).
My recommendation for people trying to make an estimate would be to time yourself during the first chapter or two, and try to extrapolate that forward. Check how many lessons, quizzes and projects you get through per hour, for example, and then count how many you have ahead of you. And of course, allow for the fact that earlier chapters are easier (faster) to complete than later (more advanced) chapters.It’ll vary with everyone. It took me around 3 weeks to do the computer science path but I had a lot of time on my hands and had done Java and C++ a decade ago. What I personally recommend is quality over quantity. If you’re doing data science path, do you have math fundamentals? Calculus, linear alg., probability, statistics come in handy if you don’t have them (with machine learning and life) so you may want to check out courses like Khan academy or MIT Opencourseware for those. There may even be times when taking other approaches is also better. (For example, I took a break from the CS path to do python out of a book and youtube and then when I came back I finished the end really quickly).
Here’s  a listed reference of potential times: https://help.codecademy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012296653-Estimated-Career-Path-Completion-Times 6I have some python knowledge and a good experience with statistics, probability and linear alg from my career, I’m an industrial engineer, but I’ll check out those websites to get more experience.

However, I couldn’t make out the difference between the correct CSS and incorrect CCS document, they looked the same to me. Anyone know what the list of errors are?I agree with you totally. I have wast videoed so much time on this and got NO help.
I wish a work through exercise video be provided."
699,JavaScript,30-Day Challenge,6,327,"I am new to coding (today is my 6th day) and I’m having a little trouble with JavaScript. I’ve only done the Introduction lessons and I’m already confused and lost. I was wondering if anyone had any resources or tips to help master the language?Hello @deemomo.

tips to help master the language


Take things slowly, don’t rush, and don’t be afraid to review concepts that you’ve already done. It also helps to set yourself tiny projects as you go along, even if it is as simple as print a variable with my name in it. Anything to get you thinking.
Whenever I face a problem I do three things:

Think about what it means, and how I would do it on paper, or in real life.
I write pseudo code. Pseudo code is just written instructions that are written like you might write code:
write a function called 'x'. Inside the function check to see if ""hi"" is equal to ""HI"". If it is, print ""yes""
This is like writing instructions for someone.
Finally, I translate the pseudo code into real code.

I hope this helps!If you’ve never coded in a C language or similar Javascript takes a while to get used to, so don’t worry. If you stick with it, it will start to make sense after a month or two.
I highly suggest using an editor like Sublime or Atom as a workstation to code. It’s just really quick for catching errors and helps you visualize and format properly (although you probably have to manually configure them to compile js, but that’s a quick 5 minute process that is easy to google).
I also find it really comforting to work with a reference book by my side just in case I want to delve into a specific topic deeply or just browse generally. I’m not familiar with the best JS books but asking for recs here and on reddit/discord/irc you can probably get a bunch of ideas. If it’s a language you’re serious about studying, those 20-40$ can go a long way (and sometimes you can easily access the books on subscription sites like scribd.Thank you SO much @codeneutrino and @toastedpitabread! I appreciate the info and advice - I will definitely take it and use it to continue my coding journey. Hello!
I started learning JavaScript about a month or so ago, so I know exactly how you feel. I’ve found that taking handwritten notes and reviewing them throughout the day has helped me IMMENSELY. It feels weird writing a digital language by hand at first, but trust me, it’s big time paying dividends for me. If you ever want someone to go through JS lessons with, let me know! We’re all in this together! Coming from a programmer by trade (Robot Programming Engineer) - I’m going to be honest, I hate reading. I am a hands on guy - some people are book smart and can just read something and soak it in, that is not me. I would like to share some things that have helped me.


Think about what you are reading. Like really think about it and get your brain in logic (1’s and 0’s).  mode. What would a computer want me to say to it? (Be one with the computer!) lol. 


Think about the big picture, what is the end goal? I’m being presented text, I’m enforcing this by
doing the actions that they ask, but WHY am I doing these items – GET THE WHY! Understand
and grasp the WHY and it’s all syntax at that point.


Make sure you have a decent place to concentrate and put your thinking cap on. Distractions
around you can and will add up. Put some headphones on with awesome music if you have to.


Depending on how detailed the problem is, make a picture, draft a flowchart, etc. Think about
the start and finish, and then define how to get there after.


Be organized, take notes, find a flow, make a “Toolbox”. I know this seems annoying. Here is
what I do, I have CC on one monitor and Microsoft Word on another. Here is my general flow.
I’ve created a folder on my Desktop. I’ve named it “CodeCademy Javascript” for example. This is
my “Toolbox”. Within my “Toolbox” I save things that are important. On each lesson start, I
download the “Cheatsheet” for that topic, even if I already think I know it, even if I think I won’t
use it - I download that bad boy. I also save the Microsoft Word Document that I have in there. In
the Microsoft Word document I take notes, and I copy/pasta the things I am doing and the
console output as a comment. This allows me to quickly go back and say, I remember something
about that, let’s reference (ON MY TERMS).


Help other people in the community. Helping people with knowledge you have iterates what you
already know. It is useful for retention!


Practice, Practice, Practice, and Reach Out. - Repeat the same lesson 10000 times until you
understand everything 100%. This goes in conjunction with utilizing the forum. At some point you might get tired of banging your head, reach out! Push yourself as much as you can though, think of how an athlete trains.


Don’t give up. No matter how hard it gets. Don’t ever give up. It’s better to aim high and miss
than aim low and hit. I have over 15 years of development experience and I still learn daily. Times
get rough, there will be things you don’t understand, keep on keeping on and have the attitude
of “I’m going to own this.” Don’t let it own you!


ALWAYS put your users first, I can’t stress this enough. When you get comfortable with your
coding. Always, put your users first. Put yourself in their shoes and think, if I was them, using
what I code, how would I want the code to act.


Don’t be afraid of failure. You can be a great programmer and make mistakes. Don’t be afraid to fail or make a mistake. It happens to all of us developers!


Edit: Another thing, comment your work as much as possible. This reinforces understanding!
2nd Edit: Don’t forget to take breaks!
In closure, I hope these tips have helped you and others. Happy coding. Hope to see your work in the future!Something that helps me too. Is when you’re working a project. Use the notes feature // in the code to explain to yourself what that section of code is. Start keeping examples and create a collection of codes snippets with your notes to go back and review."

I’m studying all things javascript BTW…
Thanx in advance!Hello @geekmonster.iot, welcome to the forums! It really depends on what you’ve done before, how well you take in info, etc. I would say about an hour a day would be quite good, but it is more the quality of the learning. You should also aim to incorporate projects into your learning.
Happy coding!A solid hour per topic can be good, if you have a lot of time you can do 2 hours in separate frames (or more) while cycling with another topic.
As @codeneutrino mentioned though, quality is key though. You want to retain, not overload. So things like organization,  note-taking, calendar-planning, all factor in. I would additionally add that you might want to diversify in resources if you’re serious in a topic (you won’t get as much theoretical knowledge in the Codecademy as you’ll get hands-on knowledge… which is just as important). Reference books or really on point videos can help supplement this.
There’s also something to be said for difficulty of material, some lighter material might be easier to retain even while studying hours a day, whereas some conceptual things have to “sit” for a few days while you chip at them (no matter how much extra time you put in)."
702,Requirements for Developing a software/application,Random,11,225,"Hi all, I wasn’t sure where to ask or whom to ask this, so I figured it would be best to place it here. That being said, my apologies if it is the wrong thread and/or not he best way to do so.
I have been learning Python and so far I have been enjoying it, however, as I have browsed through the code academy website, I haven’t been able to see any particular course or aggregation of courses that teaches you how to actually create an application. By this I mean, some form of breakdown were we (the students and learners) are shown the process or system used to take an idea and make it practical by means of coding.
Many of the courses in code academy are single language courses where you learn the syntax and the “how” of the language, but it feels as if we are still limited when it comes to being able to bring a project to life. I personally feel like there’s even more that needs to be learned in order to be able to do that, but the information might not be here in code academy.
Maybe I am just getting ahead of myself or haven’t truly seen all of the courses on this website, or perhaps I haven’t reached those levels yet. I don’t know. I just want to share the thoughts and see what any of you has to say.
I just feel limited in a way, I am learning Py with he intention of developing a language application, but there are so many aspects that go into the full creation of a software that no matter how much I might learn about coding (Py in this case), I feel like I am still in square one.Hey there,
What exactly do you mean by “a language application”? Something like Duolingo?
I’d say you’re mostly right, although some courses do teach you how to get started building for the web.


Learn Ruby and Learn Ruby on Rails 1


Learn JavaScript and Learn Node.js + the Express framework

Build Python Web Apps with Flask is coming
Learn ASP.NET is coming

But even going through those, you’d still have to do a lot of figuring things out by yourself, outside of Codecademy. It’s part of the learning process.



 data0450901425:

(the students and learners) are shown the process or system used to take an idea and make it practical by means of coding.


Definitely Learn Ruby on Rails 1. After taking this course you can get started with Rails on your very own project. But you’re into Python, and said you’re still in the process of learning it, so this is what should matter at the moment. Learn everything you can about Python first, and then (either):

Wait for Codecademy to release the Build Python Web Apps with Flask course
Learn how to set up and use Flask by yourself
Aim even bigger and learn Django by yourself
Choose another Python framework, like Web2Py, Pyramid, Tornado, or another…

Regardless, you’ll have to Google how to do most things, search StackOverflow for answers, etc.
Road is long but worth it. Get out of your comfort zone. Enjoy the process. Never give up!Thank you for the prompt reply. If I am honest with myself, I don’t know 100% what it is that I actually want to do, since there are so many ways to go about it.
I am your typical “I have no code experience whatsoever” type of person, with the exception of basic html and css. I chose to learn Py because it is a very useful language and it is great as an entry drug, so to speak, to the coding world.
I believe I want to focus on developing a web a application, but like you said, there are many options to do just that, and that is where the confusion arises.
Based on your experiences, do you believe it is adequate to continue with Py and then move on to some of its frameworks, or should I try to learn something else like ruby for instance? (I am also staring the webdev classes to refresh what I know and get a better grasp of JavaScript)
Thank you for your time, and pardon my own confusions!
[Also, what I have in mind is not like Duolingo per se. I would be happy to explain the basic idea of it, so that you have a better understanding of what I am aiming for, it that’s alright with you.]Hello @data0450901425 



 data0450901425:

do you believe it is adequate to continue with Py and then move on to some of its frameworks, or should I try to learn something else like ruby for instance?


Python is adequate to do many applications, since it has so many modules like pygame it can be used for a number of things.
https://www.pygame.org 2
However it does have its limits, especially being such a high level language, learning other code languages will be very helpful to you as a coder.



 data0450901425:

I am also staring the webdev classes to refresh what I know and get a better grasp of JavaScript


If you are wanting to do a web application, than learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several of the other languages used for web designing are a good idea.
Of course I am not saying do these all at once, as learning multiple languages at a time does not always work well. Then again you may be able to learn like this, it varies between people.


 data0450901425:

I believe I want to focus on developing a web a application, but like you said, there are many options to do just that, and that is where the confusion arises.


It’s perfectly possible to develop web applications in Python (I should know, I’ve done it).
Two of the “big names” in Python web frameworks are Flask and Django.
Flask is good if you know pretty much what you want, and want a small extensible framework that you can expand to meet your needs with no additional cruft or unnecessary extras.
Django is the opposite, with a load of functionality already there out-of-the-box to save you some work.
A good example of this difference is that Django includes the necessary code to safely deal with user authentication out of the box; Flask would require you to either write this yourself as a Blueprint, or find an extension to do it for you.
If you decide to go down this particular rabbit hole, I would recommend the MDN Django tutorial over the “official” one on the Django docs.



 data0450901425:

do you believe it is adequate to continue with Py and then move on to some of its frameworks, or should I try to learn something else like ruby for instance?


I’d be inclined to say that if you’re already learning Python, stick with Python. It’s a pretty good language, and can be applied to a broad range of uses.
Ruby, in comparison, is a bit… awkward, to put it nicely. If you were to decide you wanted to write a web app, but didn’t want to use Python for it, I’d probably suggest PHP as an alternative rather than Ruby / Rails.It really does come down to personal preference though, @thepitycoder
I’d never use Python myself for a web app, much prefer Ruby (if had to choose between the two that is).
That being said…

My answer would be:

For sure, world would be very boring if everything was done the same way. 
For the most part, I only started building things with Flask/Django because I’d started with Python and didn’t see the point in switching out to something like PHP if I could do what I needed with Python and a framework…
(I’ll probably take a look at RoR at some point, though quite a lot of my time is being spent with Kotlin and Android Studio at the moment… but I digress…)Thank you for your input @8-bitgaming, Is much appreciated!Thank you for your input @thepitycoder hank you for your input @, Is much appreciated!
Question though, correct me if I am wrong, but PHP is a back end language is still useful to learn regardless of, since it is needed for a variety of applications as well as web development, right? For whatever reason I have always seen it as a back end language and never as a regular “normal” language like Py.Well you don’t necessarily have to learn it if you don’t plan on using it.
Say you wanted your app to be written in Python, you wouldn’t have to resort to learning PHP at all.



 data0450901425:

since it is needed for a variety of applications as well as web development


I don’t think PHP has much prevalence outside of web development.
But if there’s one thing that PHP does really well, it’s being a great back-end language for the web.
It’s kind of lost its appeal to numerous web devs (which I won’t be getting into right now…), but it’s still very popular mostly because a big part of the web still runs on PHP.
Facebook was built with it (now turned Hack, a dialect of PHP).
Wikipedia.
Yahoo.
Many others.
And, of course, WordPress. This one being the main reason PHP is still “popular” (good, and bad).
It’s my language of choice, always has been, and although it’s not perfect, it’s pretty good at what it does. But it’s definitely not a de facto requirement.
If you like Python, though, stick with it, it’s a good choice. Besides, you’ll also have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several other things to get your web app running.
My two cents I think I have a better Idea now. Thanks @ghostlovescore !

Getting started - essential things you should know from the get go
About this Guide
I’m a developer and I’ve been tutoring new coders for years, I teamed up with some other people like me to make this guide to help out any new developer get the context and advice they need to get going.  Wanna know more about these guides (there are others), me, and why we made them?  See here.
Foundations
Here’s a video with some advice to keep in mind before you go too deep down the rabbit hole:
What I Wish I Knew When I First Started Coding
Before you jump into one language or another, it can really help to orient yourself first.  All too often students just jump into something like C++ and get turned off immediately.  Take your time.  I’d recommend you practice basic coding principles (take this 3.3k mini course) and get some context on coding in general (with this 1.0k mini path).  Those resources are very quick, just take them, they’ll help to put everything else into perspective and will demystify things for you.  The first one is 100% free, the second is part of Pro but you can easily complete it in the 7 day free Pro trial that they give every new account.  You need to educate yourself even just a little in order to understand everything else.  Do these first and then move on.
Picking a Path
There are many languages to choose from, pick the right one for you:
Which Programming Language Should You Choose?
There are many also many paths to take in coding, pick the right one for you:
How to Pick a Path
If you’ve followed my advice with the foundations above, you can make a fairly educated choice now. If you’re worried about picking the wrong thing, don’t be, there’s usually not a “wrong” choice for beginners per se.  Programmers switch languages quite often even late in their journey and especially when starting out.  Don’t wallow in doubt, just start with something!  Once you’ve started and gained some skills you’ll know more about how to answer your own questions and hone in on the right thing.
Even when I tell people that all, they still ask me for “the right thing to learn for beginners” or some such.  Really that depends on you, but for most people I recommend starting with HTML and CSS because even though they aren’t “programming languages” per se, they do get you started with code easier than most other ways, and you can see the results far faster.  Whatever path you’ll take, even if it’s game development, you could do with knowing at least some HTML and CSS and you can get the basics quickly with these 398 two 229 free courses.  If you’re learning web development, read this 339 to learn more about what languages to learn and why.  If you aren’t interested in learning web development at all and want to learn computer science or data analysis instead, you don’t need HTML / CSS, so Python (free course here 228) is probably right for you.
How long it takes to learn to code depends on your outcome, but here 246’s a video with an overview.  For everyone, don’t expect learning to happen quickly, and don’t cut corners.
What you can expect / wisdom
You’re going to get a wave of confidence early that will collapse soon thereafter, and that’s totally normal!  It’s called the Dunning-Kruger effect, you can read more about it here 511.  Knowing this crisis is coming should help you to pull through.
Coding is hard (read this 435).  There will come a point when you’ll look back at the beginning parts and think it’s easy, that’s what a lot of people might be telling you now, but it’s always hard and that’s okay, every coder struggles and there are ways to get through (watch this 234).
You’re going to get stuck.  A lot.  That’s normal, it’s part of the process (read this 164 to learn about how to embrace that).
You’re probably going to experience imposter syndrome, it happened to me and every other dev I know, here 341’s a good blog post how to fight it.
At some point, whatever path you take, you’re going to get to a stage where you need to move beyond tutorials and find answers yourself in order to get the job done.  The biggest things that will help you here are: 1) Google, which will take you to… 2) developer documentation (read this 160 to learn how to use it) 3) the developer community.  Developer communities come in all shapes and sizes, and the bigger ones like Stack Overflow 83 will be vital for you someday (same for every developer) but they aren’t always super friendly for beginners.  Making communities great is a group effort, and as a person asking questions you can make them better by asking good quality questions (here’s 81 how) and doing your due diligence beforehand.
The Coding Mindset and Other Key (Neglected) Skills
There are certain qualities that successful developers have, more skills than just coding skills, and most sites or bootcamps don’t teach you these, or at least not directly.  See this video 375 and this 261 list of tips for an overview.  If you want more quick tips on some other skills you’ll need to succeed, read the articles here 185 and here 111.
Watch this video on DRY 488 – this will save you so much time and effort!
Read this 312 to learn how to think like a programmer. Programming is about more than coding, it’s a mindset (read this 218), and that mindset isn’t hard to learn.  Learn it early on and you’ll benefit all the way through your journey.
There are tried and true ways to get unstuck (watch this video 79).  First, try to solve your own problems (you’ll learn a lot by doing so!) by paying attention to and Googling your error messages, looking for typos, syntax errors, and so on.  Use the rubber ducky method 169 (yes, seriously) and pseudocode (walkthrough here 62) for self-help with bigger problems.  If you’ve done all of these steps and are still stuck, ask for help – including the context you learned by trying to DIY, appropriate links, your formatted code, and everything that can make it easy for someone to help you.
You’re gonna debug a lot, but most places don’t teach you how (at least explicitly), so here are 10 tips 115 for doing so.
You should know how to write clean code and have good quality code.  Read this 93 and this 69 for how.
Finding a coding mentor is hard, but valuable.  If you pay, like if you go to a bootcamp like I did, they come with it, and some paid Codecademy options can give you access to mentors, but there are other ways too and it doesn’t hurt to have more.  Read this 67.
Essential Developer Tools
Chrome 70 is pretty much the default developer browser, and these 494 extensions make it more useful.  You’ll want to use dev tools, they’re legit, read this 244 and watch this 105 for how.
You’re going to need a text editor.  There are lots of options (see here 200), and there are pros and cons (e.g. read this 91 for two top options versus one-another).  Atom and Sublime Text are both popular, check them out here 63. Visual Studio seems most popular with devs in 2019, follow this 143 video walkthrough to set it up.  Try a few of them, see what you like more, but if you just want a recommendation, I’d say use Visual Studio.
Real-time collaboration tools for developers are super handy, here 85’s a list.  You might need these later.  I like Glitch 58.  Repl 61 is also great, and as a bonus it was built by one of Codecademy’s engineers so it’ll be familiar to you.  You can also use tools like Repl or Codepen 47 to fiddle with and share smaller snippets of code or projects.

Think about your overall day. Think about what time you can spare.
Come up with a personal goal. What do I want to accomplish? Be realistic. Give yourself padding.
Communicate this time frame to whoever you need to. Explain why and give exact time frames if needed. (if this applies)

Stick to your commitments. As stated in step 4, it’s a 2 way street. Don’t burn the candle at both ends. It WILL burn you out, and I can promise that from experience.

Excited to read about everyone’s win! I got inspired by others here and now I have a 6-day coding streak on the DS path. I am going back over functions b/c I feel like it’s always good to practice core concepts.
I also started crocheting another small blanket in two colors (so far). It’s a different, newer (to me) stitch and it gave me ideas about creating scarves as well. It’s supposed to be 30"" x 30"" and will go on a chair where my cat sleeps on her heating pad. (She’s older and has arthritis, thus the heating pad.)   I realized my technology-related knowledge had some weak spots, and decided to learn everything I could about how the Internet works. So far so good! It’s really satisfying to learn how the things I take for granted actually work 
I also learned to manage my time in a more productive way. I made myself aware of the time I actually spend doing stuff. I decided I would spend less time in low-density fun activities that slowly take up my time (aka scrolling through social media) and make me feel like I didn’t do anything I enjoyed in that day. Instead, I’m now learning to focus in hard tasks for longer periods of time (2-3hrs) and giving myself a longer, enjoyable break doing something I actually love.

All elements of the sum are the results of integer division. Continue dividing the number until you reach a decimal (no decimals allowed in final answer).
Example
25 => 25 + 12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 47
Tests
halvingSum(25)

This challenge 3 comes from Belia on CodeWars. Thank you to CodeWars 2, who has licensed redistribution of this challenge under the 2-Clause BSD License!Fun one.


This works...
def halving_sum(n):
    return 1 if n <= 1 else n + halving_sum(n//2)

Cool problem.
This works but looks a bit clunky…


halving_sum

>>> def halving_sum(n):
	return sum([int(n * 2**(-x)) for x in range(0, n + 1) if int(n * 2**(-x)) > 0])

>>> halving_sum(25)
47
>>> halving_sum(127)
247
>>> 


That was an enjoyable challenge.
My answer ain’t as pretty looking, but at least I got it done.


A Solution

def halving_sum(n):
    result = float(n)
    work = float(n) / 2
    
    while work >= 1:

      if work.is_integer():
        result += work
      else:
        result += int(work)

      work /= 2
    return result

print(halving_sum(25)) #should equal 47
print(halving_sum(127)) #should equal 247


Another kick at the comprehension.


halving_sum with log
>>> from math import log, ceil
>>> def halving_sum(n):
	return [int(n * 2**(-x)) for x in range(0, ceil(log(2*n) / log(2)))]

>>> halving_sum(25)

Okay, one more crack, this time with floor instead of ceil.

I saw this answer in the comments of the original post:


Another answer
const half = n => n && half(n>>1) + n
Bit shifting! This is one juicy tasty solution
Rather obvious once we remove our blinders.
I was fixated on the series converging on 2 * n.


half.py
>>> def half(n):
	return n and half(n >> 1) + n

>>> half(25)
47
>>> half(127)
247
>>> 



I did something quite useless.
The value is repeatedly bitshifted, losing one digit and lowering the value of all the remaining digits
The lowest bit is used one time as 1 (total 1)
The second is used twice, as 2 and 1 (total 3)
The third is used three times, as 4 2 1 (total 7)
The fourth is used four times, as 8 4 2 1 (total 15)
… and so on
that sum (1 3 7 15 31 …) is a power of 2 minus 1
bitvalue n = 2 ^ (n + 1) - 1

where n=0 is the first bit
…except, may as well do it with bit shifting
bitvalue n = 2 `shiftL` n - 1

I can then create a list for how much each bit is worth
bitvalues = map bitvalue [0 ..]

which gets me this:
> take 15 bitvalues
[1,3,7,15,31,63,127,255,511,1023,2047,4095,8191,16383,32767]

If i then have the bits of some number
bits n = fromEnum <$> unfoldr next n
  where next x = if x == 0 then Nothing else Just (testBit x 0, shiftR x 1)

> bits 4
[0,0,1]
> bits 1234897
[1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1]

I can zip that with how much they’re worth
> zip (bits 1234897) bitvalues
[(1,1),(0,3),(0,7),(0,15),(1,31),(0,63),(1,127),(1,255),(1,511),(1,1023),(1,2047),(0,4095),(1,8191),(0,16383),(1,32767),(1,65535),(0,131071),(1,262143),(0,524287),(0,1048575),(1,2097151)]

multiply each pair (1 -> keep, 0 -> drop)
> zipWith (*) (bits 1234897) bitvalues
[1,0,0,0,31,0,127,255,511,1023,2047,0,8191,0,32767,65535,0,262143,0,0,2097151]

and sum them
halvingSum n = sum $ zipWith (*) (bits n) bitvalues

…refactor a bit
halvingSum = sum . zipWith (*) bitvalues . bits

And all that is useless because it’s one iteration per bit which is the same number of iterations as one would get by repeatedly halving the value.
For manual computation I imagine this would be faster, but computers happen to be good at summing and halving large numbers and rather bad at looking at individual bits.
https://repl.it/repls/CylindricalUtilizedBlocks 1


Oh yeah...
I can do this
2 ^ (n + 1) - 1

for all bits simultaneously by multiplying the number by 2 and subtracting 1 for each active bit
halvingSum n = 2 * n - popCount n

or, as python:
def halvingSum(n):
    return (n << 1) - f'{n:b}'.count('1')


bitshifting can eat it."

Did you have a multiple-day coding streak?


Did you debug some code that was throwing an error?


Did you learn a new skill that wasn’t coding?


Excited to read about everyone’s win! I primarily use Colab, but, I finally figured out how to run Jupyter Notebook after updating my OS to Catalina over a month ago. I couldn’t run Anaconda and tried fixing the problem, but, it didn’t really work. I found an article on Medium that fixed the issue. https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/how-to-run-jupyter-notebook-on-macos-catalina-in-four-steps-f7cc4e2cc270 3
I also finished crocheting a small, multi-colored  blanket.Fixing things that don’t work but you know they should is oh so very satisfying and kudos on the crochet; I’ve never tried, but having seen how long it takes even the smallest of items is impressive.
A very small win- I’ve been using git and github for a few old projects but I mostly use it to host chunks of useful or interesting code that I’d like to keep a record of. On a PC that’s fine but I’ve been periodically using Pythonista on a tablet for quick practice sessions and so on. With some 3rd party tools I’ve been able to keep the repo in check between these devices but I’ve had a few deletions (the tools on the tablet are very limited and it struggles to keep track of directories so I’ve had pushes that wiped files from the master). A lot of trial and error but I got it work by using branches on both devices but only ever merging on the PC. Not the cleverest solution but it does the job so I’ll not complain.
Other wins involved finally getting out in my playboat again and managing to host an online quiz for a group of old friends the other day (it was chaotic but I think it went well enough).I started using the Tkinter module in Python, and I got both a Github account and a Discord account set up.Finally finished the CS career path! Diving into R until I get ideas for my next set of study goals.45 days streak so far.
Still fight my way through the web developer path but I started already with the Data Science path since this topic is pretty close to what I have done in my company for a while (analyzing support ticket content). I’m working in home office and the deal with me is to turn the time to commute into time to lern. So, before I start my work I code at least one hour (Web Dev path). After work I spend an hour with my secret passion Data Science.
I won more practice, more knowledge and more dedication to go this way.Update: the fix I thought worked for Jupyter/Anaconda didn’t. Argh.YAY! that’s awesome!Oh no 
I used to use conda for a few things as the versioning worked well for me at the time but I kind of went off it for one reason or another. I did have success with installing miniconda with the .pkg install only a few weeks ago on Catalina though I didn’t use it for much. I’m not sure if Jupyter is included with the limited install than miniconda provides but you should be able to add it afterwards. Might be worth a look-in if you’re having no luck with the package managers.Oh, cool. Thanks for the heads up. I’m terrible at command line stuff in the terminal. (I should be better at it).
I’ve been using Google’s Colab for awhile now and I really like it. Especially since you can upload directly to GitHub. I cursed at Anaconda yesterday (i’m sure they heard me. haha). I mean, why make something that doesn’t work on an o/s that so many ppl use?
smh. I’ve posted on my github 2 all the 7 Python Challenge Projects. Still continue to edit them using new methods I’m learning (I found out about walrus operator yesterday!) but think about starting some really big and challenge project.I have a 5 day streak on Codecademy, and am almost done with Code Foundations.
I also have been on Khan Academy every day learning a lot of new math, which has been really fun. Also have been supplementing that with math lessons in Japanese on YouTube to learn the terminology (because I want to study math in Japan.)
I haven’t written any of my own code this week, really. I did get a domain for myself to play with, so after I finish the last Code Foundations module, I’d like to spend at least half my time just trying to make something. Been a fun week though!
Edit: Oh I also weaved a tapestry? Never done that before, but it’s pretty cute."
718,[Blog] Technical interview preparation: 6 tips from Codecademy developers,Community,0,250,"technical-interview-preparation-tips.png2000×840
Technical interviews offer potential employers a way to see how you think
on your feet, and to make sure that your skills stack up against your resume.
But if you’ve never had a technical interview before, we know just how
nerve racking it can be — especially when it’s the last stage in your journey
to landing the job you’ve dreamed of.
To help you prepare, we’ve compiled some tips from Alisha and Ian, the
Curriculum Developers behind our Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript 6 Skill
Path. You can learn more about this course 3 at
the end of this article.
“Technical interviews can be stressful, but the skills you need to pass
them are ones that you'll use throughout your career,” Alisha tells us.
Our objective is to help set you up for success — both in your interview
and in your career as a software developer.
What is a technical interview?
Before we share tips on how to prepare for a technical interview, we thought
we’d share a quick rundown of what a technical interview is in the first
place. The technical interview is one component of the overall interview
process, which can include a combination of phone screens, in-person interviews,
take-home or in-person assignments and more.
While every company is different, the technical interview usually involves
a question where you'll be asked to implement a specific function or program.
The interviewer will usually explain the problem, let you ask questions
about intended behavior, and then it's up to you to implement a solution!
Some interviews will happen with real code in a code editor, and some will
have you write code out by hand on a whiteboard.
Your technical interview may include anything from debugging existing
code, building a small project, adding a feature to an existing code base,
or talking about the design and architecture for a technical problem. If
you can, ask your main contact at the company if they can provide information
about what to expect before you head in for an interview.
Technical interview preparation tips
These technical interview preparation tips were compiled by our Curriculum
Developers, Ian and Alisha, based on their work on Pass the Technical Interview
with JavaScript — and their own experience with technical interviews.
Practice
“The best way to prep for a technical interview is to practice,” says
Ian. “Try solving practice technical interview questions and problems,
studying up on your language of choice, or even practicing in person with
a friend.”
Simply spending time building your own projects is also a great way to
prepare for technical interviews. Working on personal projects gives you
the opportunity to think through your approach and problem-solve on your
own — the very skills that technical interviews are designed to test.
Know your language
Most technical interviewers will let you complete your in-person or remove
technical interview in the language of your choosing. If you’ve landed
a technical interview, chances are that you already know at least one programming
language really well at this point, so stick with the language you’re most
comfortable with!
“You might need to know how a particular built-in method works in order
to analyze the runtime complexity of your answer, or you might be able
to use a novel language feature to make your solution more optimized or
more idiomatic and readable,” Ian says. “Knowing your language like the
back of your hand will help you concentrate on the problem itself rather
than thinking about syntax.”
Ask questions
Alisha and Ian stress the importance of asking questions during your technical
interview. “Ask any question that comes to your mind! It's much easier
to get rid of any ambiguity before you start coding than when you're
halfway through implementing a solution that might be built on false assumptions!”
Clarify the problem up front and gather as much information as you need
to execute on it effectively. Here are some things to consider asking:

Ask about any edge cases.
Make sure you understand how the program should behave given certain inputs.
Ask whether you need to build in error handling.
Repeat the problem back to the interviewer so they can set you on the
right track if you got anything wrong.

Think about your approach
Just as asking questions is important to ensure you completely understand
the task at hand, taking time to think about your approach is important.
“In a technical interview,” says Ian, “one of the biggest pitfalls is to
jump in and start coding right away.”
“At the beginning of your technical interview session, take the time to
think through different approaches to the problem. Talk through those approaches
out loud. Don't worry about saying things that seem obvious or unimportant
— it could be that you missed an edge case, and talking through the problem
out loud will help you catch it!”
Get to a solution, then optimize
“The most important thing in an interview is to show the interviewer that
you can think through a problem,” says Ian. “Work to get there first, and
then go back and clean up your code. It can be very tempting to jump to
fancy techniques, but many if not most interview problems can be solved
using basic language features. Sometimes the best way to start out is with
the humble `for` loop!”
“After you've got a basic working solution, now it's time to handle edge
cases and optimizations. Chances are, your interviewer will appreciate
that you first got something that worked and then continued to spruce it
up. As you optimize, talk about what you're doing and how it improves your
program. If you know how to analyze the Big O runtime of your solutions
and figure out ways to improve it, now's the time to show that off.”
Talk, talk, talk
Last but not least, Ian and Alisha recommend talking — a lot. “The
more you can talk, the more your interviewer will understand your thinking.”
Understanding how you think and how you approach problems is, in large
part, why the technical interview exists. So talking through your process
is big.
“If you get stuck while solving a problem, don't clam up. Talk through
your issue. The more you can talk, the more your interviewer will understand
your thinking, and hearing yourself out loud may even cause you to reconsider
your approach.” As an added benefit of talking, some interviewers will
offer tips or a helping hand along the way — and many will be more willing
to do this if you're already having a lively dialogue.
We know that talking out loud while coding is not the most natural thing
for many programmers. If it feels awkward or uncomfortable to you, that’s
totally normal. Try practicing with a friend to get more comfortable with
it.

The tips in this article are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes
to prepping for your technical interview. Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript 6 offers
a deep dive into technical interview preparation.
This Skill Path is meant for developers who are familiar and experienced
with a programming language (preferably JavaScript), and are looking for
their first full-time position as a software developer. We won't teach
you the basics of JavaScript in this course. Rather, we'll teach you how
to apply it to classic computer science problems to set you up for success
in your technical interviews.
We hope the course helps you learn a new way of thinking that’ll set you
up to land the job you’ve been dreaming of!

720,Career option: QA Engineer,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",4,242,"Hello, my name is Pablo and I’ve completed courses for Ruby,  JAVA, Javascript, SQL, Command Line, Building APIs from scratch, and currently doing Python. I’m a QA Engineer transitioning to Software Engineering Manager and I’m here to help out people as I can. Working on a couple of ideas to engage with the community and with Alyssa to set up some Q&A sessions.
After completing one of the courses, a lot of you ask: Now what?
Well, aside from being an app developer a good option is to be a QA Engineer. But what exactly does that mean? QA -> Quality Assurance
A QA Engineer should be part of any development team, they validate the requirements from the stakeholders and maintain the quality of the product. I say should be because a lot of companies don’t see the value in having a QA resource, and expect the developer to be responsible for the quality of their own code. To an extent, that statement is correct but a QA mindset is very different than a developer mindset.
Why? We find bugs in the code by testing the functionality, manually using the app.
How? Mostly by asking “what if I do this…”, we have inquisitive minds that don’t like to do as we’re told.


Hey, can you test the login page?


Sure.
– use a good password
– use a bad password
– use a SQL statement instead of a username (anybody know little Bobby tables?)
– use a Js script instead of a username


Found a bug.


Wait, what? How did you crash the system?


Because you didn’t sanitize your db inputs.


Developers usually only do what they’re told, unless you give them very specific instructions they don’t ask the ""what if’s. QA does.
Eventually, all apps are too big to be able to execute every possible scenario manually in a reasonable timeframe (regression cycle). That’s where the Engineer part and your recently completed course come in. Instead of manually testing every flow in the app, you can automate it. Use Python, JAVA, Javascript, or any other number of languages and you can automate a piece of software.
Tired of testing the login page every single time? Write a script for it, it will execute automatically and you can worry about more critical areas of the app.
Automation can be done on the front end, the back end, on mobile apps, or the pipeline. What tools or language you use depends largely on the project at hand.
Questions, comments?
Discuss.Wow! thanks for all the info. The first question that came to my mind was…
Are QA engineering jobs available to entry or junior level developers?
because it sounds like QA engineers have quite a bit of responsibility and tell others what's wrong with their code.Wow quality advise
Thank You very muchShort answer: yes.
Real answer: yes but… just like for a developer, you’ll need some experience in actual QA as well as writing automation code.
Like I said, QA people have a specific mindset that makes them stand out. You may be able to write the code, but it might not end up being an enjoyable experience. While it is an option, it’s not for everybody.
Companies have job postings looking for an automation engineer, but in reality you won’t be writing code 100% of the time. You’re going to have to do manual testing because automation is always falling behind and the code still needs to be tested. In 11 years I’ve never been part of a company that actually has a QA Engineer writing code all day.
What can you do to get some automation experience?

learn about Selenium
once you know the basics of Selenium, find a framework that supports the language you learned
take the apps you’ve written recently and apply some automation to it
take any site you like, write some scripts for it. In this sense, it’s a little easier to gain experience because you can apply it to any existing site or app.

Regarding QA experience… that’s a whole other topic. Unlike developers, QA needs to have a lot more knowledge. As a developer, you can focus only on the front end, or only on the backend. And that’s fine, but QA needs to know about both. A good QA resource will at least match, if not exceed the knowledge of a developer. They just use it in a different way.
Also, something I mentioned in another post. Just because you know Python doesn’t mean you can use it for every single automation project. Some apps benefit from automation in Python, others from Javascript, others in Ruby. As a QA Engineer, you need to be flexible and adaptable. You need to be able to pick up a new language when required. You don’t have to master it, but you need to be able to pick it up with little effort in a reasonable amount of time.
Once you enter the coding world, deadlines are constantly changing and everything is important so your manager is always going to push you to get things done quickly. This is true for developers and QA.Excellent post.
In some ways, the job of QA Engineer sounds very similar to some roles you’d find within the infosec space… in as much as part of the role is focused on poking applications to see whether they behave in an unanticipated (or potentially exploitable) manner.

Today we’re starting to roll out a change to your dashboard by adding a toolkit, shown below, starting with 20% of users.
Screen_Shot_2020-06-02_at_10_09_38_PM1498×1448 203 KB
The resources in your toolkit will change, so keep an eye on it, they should be useful for you!  Over time, we will be making this toolkit a smarter companion to your learning journey, depending on your goals and how you’re using Codecademy.  We’re excited to build that for you!
This toolkit replaces the former ‘practice’ tab showing our optional challenge projects.  Our data showed that this tab wasn’t particularly useful to you, but for those few who were using it, we’ve included links to those projects below.  They are also being incorporated into course and path syllabi (this is underway but as of writing not yet shipped), and still available with the ‘apply’ card on your dashboard.
We’re always working to improve learning on Codecademy, how can this toolkit be better (we have some ideas but want your take)?  Let us know in the comments!

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'quantile'


Seems the error message is pretty clear. There is no attribute ‘quantile’; but, there is likely an attribute, quartile.But how is it possible in all the Previous Exercises we have been taught this command and it worked also in my NotebookMost of all there’s no command like quartile but quantileLet me get caught up to you. I’m in and out so it might not be until a little later this afternoon. (It’s 1330h MDT, here.)No no Don’t worry. It’s 2:20AM here and i’m gonna get some sleep.I’ll keep giving it a go and see how I do.Had a check of the numpy version running for these lessons (numpy.version.version) and it’s listed as 1.13.3 whereas the function you’re after says it’s ‘New in version 1.15.0.’. I’d assume previous lessons were using a different version for one reason or another. Perhaps it was partly intentional to remove some of numpy’s shortcuts and make learners follow the lessons more closely, who knows? 
Details of the numpy.quantile function-

D’oh! We see that I stand corrected. As you were.
Let’s see where things stand once the information above gets to the Learning Experience team at CC.Thankyou soo much for checking my Query @mtf @tgrtim. I’m really Grateful for it.Can you recall the lessons in which you were able to use this function? It does seem a little odd to swap between module versions if the lessons are linked together.Quantile Function right… It’s this Exercise 9"

726,"My story, learning to code with my disability","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",5,224,"Hi,
My name is Rosita, I am 36 years old and living in the Netherlands.
About  4 years ago I started a blog about living with cerbral palsy, because I just quited my bachelor study social work and I didn’t know what to do next. I was getting treatment in a rehabilitation center because of cerebral palsy. I found out I coudn’t become a social worker anymore. But I liked blogging and I learned to type blind with just my left hand.
(I am able to walk, I am spastic on my right arm and leg and I have some issues with planning, organizing and keeping an overview over things)
Trough blogging I discoverd I liked the technical stuff behind my selfhosted WordPress website and in November 2017 I became a free member at Codecademy and started to learn the basics of HTML and CSS and I also tried Javascript. Javascript was hard, so I gave up and I wasn’t motivated anymore. I still wanted to learn how to build websites.
In March this year I got a chance to visit a company who builds WordPress websites Now I decided I wanted to become a webdeveloper and I became a promember at Codecademy. As from March 13th this year I have been coding everyday. I finished:
Welcome To Codecademy,
Learn CSS,
Learn Responsive Design,
Learn HTML,
Learn Color Design,
Learn Navigation Design,
Learn How To Code,
Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Github Pages,
Code Foundations
Now I am doing the Webdevelopment Career Path and again I am learning Javascript.
I am starting to understand it better now, but it’s still very hard. I can do the lessons and the quizes, but Applying is, is so hard. How to learn to apply? Anyway I will get there and I hope to get a job in (web)development.Hi Rosita,
Thank you so much for sharing your story! Applying computer science knowledge is always hard at first but once you start doing it more often, you’ll become more comfortable with it’s difficulty!
I like the following ideas when trying to apply my textbook-learned skills:


Try emulating a simple project (like if you see a website that does something you think you can do, try seeing if you can copy that exact effect). Getting exactly right is not the point, the key is the mental journey to problem-solve how to do it. You benefit from the success and the difficulty of this.


Test and explore boundaries: this is the opposite of #1, so basically I’ll follow documentation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and I will try all the little effects and see how far they go (even if it looks ugly). While it might not be applicable at first, it can plant seeds for future usage of certain features.


Write pseudo-code. This is a very powerful one. Write code in plain language with barely any mark-up. Try to make a project or page like this on plain paper. The beauty of this is it has many benefits:



giving yourself an organized layout of what your code might look like
highlighting certain concepts you need that you haven’t learned so far (which means you can research how to do these)
it’s a great tool you’ll need when working in teams since in the initial stages it’s important to prototype ideas.

And stay positive! Every little step adds up and adds to your arsenal of skills (especially the mistakes). As much as I might dread a bug in my code, I always see it as an opportunity to gain a better understanding not only of the code itself, but my learning process. Over time this creates more enjoyable and rewarding learning experiences.Thanks! I  am going to try it out! I feel like I am in a rut. But I have some ideas.Hi Rosita,
You’re actually in a very unique position to help out a lot of people around the world. People who have disabilities similar to yours usually have a hard time accessing resources online, specifically because most companies do not support the WCAG standard. This standard is what allows screen readers and similar tools to identify elements in a website, so a user like yourself can interact with them. The best thing you can do for your future career as a web developer is to apply the standard to any website you build. Companies are starting to pay attention to this, some countries are even discussing laws to make it a requirement. If you can master that skill, it’ll make you stand out when looking for a job or branching out on your own.
Here is a link to find out more about the standard: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/
Here is a link to find out more about a tool that helps you validate the standard being applied to a website: https://pa11y.org/ 1Thank you. That means a lot to me. I already try to use those standerds, like always using alt tags, using contrast checker, large fonts.That’s awesome, but know there is a lot more to it. I will be required to test those features on the app my team is building, the research I’ve done so far for what I need to do in order to validate the functionality is overwhelming. It can be very complex depending on what the app is required to support. If you do this right, it can also give you project management skills that can land you a lead position in a team."

Everything you need to know about Git, Github, and the technical side of coding with others
What Git and GitHub Are and Why You Need Them
If you want to be a developer or know how developers work, you need to know it.  Anyone interested in coding should at least know what GitHub is 231 and why you need it 109 (two articles).
Learn Command Line, Git, and GitHub
Git is hard…

…but you still need it.  All too often I see beginner developers or even job applicants without knowing any command line, git, or github.  I even know web dev path 38 students who’ve skipped it because it’s hard.  Don’t.
I recommend taking these free courses and resources in this order:


Learn the command line 339 (course)
Set up command line part 1 112 and 2 52 (articles)

Learn Git 178 (course)

Learn Git Branching 82 (tutorial)

Get started 54 with Git and GitHub (video, goes with this 29 article)
Read the handbook 76

Learn basic markdown with this quick guide 34 (this forum also uses markdown!)

Visualize 44 the flow.
Say hello world 28! (tutorial)

Practice 31 with GitIt (tutorial)
Set up GitHub Desktop 28 (this is optional but recommended)
Know what a pull request 22 is (video)
Learn about forks 21 (article)
Know how to make 14 a pull request (article)
Know how to review pull request changes 11 (article)
Learn branching and making edits 10 (wiki)
Know how to log issues 11 (quick article; optional but recommended: master 4 them with another article).
Know how GitHub Pages 21 work and use it yourself 10 (article, then video – these are optional but recommended if you’re doing any web dev work)
Know how to make a contribution 11 on GitHub with this walkthrough (optional: learn doing so on desktop 3 with another walkthrough).
Always keep documentation 10 (article)

Keep using Git and GitHub constantly as you learn.  Make mini projects and keep using GitHub for version control and hosting.  Practice practice practice!
Working together with other people on coding projects leads to code bases, legacy code, and that can lead to problems.  Watch these three videos in this order to learn about them and how to deal with them: (code bases 12, legacy code 12, working on or with code written by others 12).
Supplemental Resources
These resources are helpful for best practices and advice:


Everyday Git commands 36 (article)

Common Git issues and how to resolve them 6 (this 3 is also good, both are articles)

How to review someone else’s code 4 (video) and specifically reviewing someone else’s pull request 11 (article).

Cool things you can do with Github 7 (listicle)

Even with the above, many students want or need more practice or to take a different angle on learning.  Try these:


GitHub Help 9 (help center)

GitHub Lab Tutorials 13 (tutorial)

Git documentation 5 (documentation)

Git Cheat Sheets 11 (article)

Oh S**t Git 16 (quick article) - this is heavy on curse words so… be warned I guess

Command Line Cheat Sheet 5: Essential tasks on the command line, plus tips and tricks

Git Cheat Sheet 8: Important Git commands and version control best practices

Bash Learning Game 10: Learn Bash by exploring the world of Terminus

Git and GitHub Training 8: Official GitHub YouTube training and guides channel

Git guide 9 (ebook)

You Can Skip Steps… But Not For Long

Maybe you’re looking at those lists above and you’re saying “nooope.”  You aren’t alone 4 (discussion thread).  In fairness you can use GitHub to some extent without going the “right way” in learning command line or Git, and that may okay for you if you don’t want to be a developer and you just want to use basic GitHub features.  There aren’t many good guides to do this, in part because the GitHub UI is quite good and in part because this is an unsual route, so watch the first two videos here 6 then this 3 article, then say hello world 28, consider doing the learning lab 13 tutorial, and then just use the GitHub UI to do what you need to do; it’s fairly straightforward.
About this Guide
I’m a developer and I’ve been tutoring new coders for years, I made this guide with some others like me because the biggest thing that trips up new developers like us is that most places don’t teach you how coding works in teams.  Wanna know more about these guides (there are others), us, and why we made them?  See here.  Interested in the wider context of who does what on a developer team and how they work together?  Check this 6 out.

Not The End
Please reply to this thread with your own resources, advice, and feedback! We made this post a wiki so it can be updated and maintained by the community, we’re just starting them off.  See our other guides here.Something that helped me learn about pull requests was seeing a video tutorial on how to make one. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ&t=134s 34Git is probably the biggest technical hurdle when working with teams. But once you get a good handle on it, it becomes a lot easier to collaborate on code.The first time I recall hearing about Git and Github is when I was working as as support contractor at NOAA.  The programmers (I wasn’t there as a programmer.) referenced it from time to time. In case you missed it: This is a tool professional programmers – well paid at that – use."
729,How many hours of work on average is needed to finish the Data Science course?,Community,2,209,"Somewhere on the course it said 35 weeks. But I wanted to understand how many hours each day should I invest to complete it in 35 weeks? If there is someone on this forum who has done this and can give me this information, it would be great so I can budget time accordingly 
Also, useful to note that I have zero programming knowledge, used to be good with math.Hi there, welcome to the forums.
Yes, the estimate for the Data Science career path is 35 weeks. What is never provided is how that number is arrived at, though. As a result, whenever anyone has asked a similar question here I have given them the same answer - an hour a day is a reasonable estimate for the time you ought to be putting in.
However, the thing that you ought to remember is that this is just an estimate. You may assimilate the concepts being taught more quickly, or more slowly, than the “average” and that will impact the rate at which you progress through the material. This is of no consequence, though; as Codecademy is not your school / college, there are no final exams, no deadlines, and the only person holding you to account to do the work (and not cheat) is yourself.
If you want to do that path, I would encourage you to do so but I would also encourage you to relieve yourself of any arbitrary time constraints or notions that there is a “correct pace” at which you should proceed through the topics.
The pace at which you complete the material here is of no importance to anyone. What you ought to be judging yourself on is how well you have absorbed the material, not how quickly you got to the “finish”.Thank you for the response. I also suspected this would be the answer. This is the first time I am doing a coding course, so the beginning has been slow so far. May be I will edit the post after a couple of months and see how long I needed. Thank you! "

731,"What are the ways that you (yes, you) practice coding each day?",30-Day Challenge,5,211,"Hey guys! I thought I’d start this thread as I’ve seen a lot of people asking the same question. What better way for people to find answers and be inspired than to just open it up as a group discussion? :-3
To start, here are some of the ways I like to practice:

Find super cool things on code-pen that you want to recreate (p.s. code-pen is awesome)
Find something on a website that looks super awesome and try to recreate it on your own (DevTools can help you out there) Can’t think of anything awesome? I find the dropdown menu that shows up when you select your icon on code-academy pretty interesting, and I want to recreate it tomorrow (as an example).
Google “practice CSS grid projects” or “practice html project ideas”, etc–you will find looooaaaaddddssss of materials.  Loads.

Do the code_academy build challenges (and don’t follow the directions/use the directions as hints)
Make stuff up and make it on your local computer with a code editor (I use atom, its free and easy to use)
Do tutorials on youtube, my favorite are code ninja videos, its a dope youtube channel where some British guy teaches you a programming/coding topic and provides a follow along project to do while you watch it~  preetttyyy doooppeee

Play coding games (just look them up, there are  lots . For example, I like grid critters and flex zombies)
Just keep creating! Even if its super stupid, just make stuff up. The more you use it, the better you will become at it.
Do a project a day! (or more if you want)

Can’t wait to hear from you guys!I personally loooove the idea of trying to recreate something from a cool website, I should try it soon 
I like to practice coding by analyzing my life and finding problems I can solve with coding. For example, I am currently working on a money management Android app for myself (even though there are already MAAANY out there, I wanted to give it a try myself).
But also you just made me realize I should start practicing a little more, since I have been taking a lot of courses lately and there’s no way all that information will stay in my brain if I don’t give it some use. So thanks! 
Btw your moving profile picture freaked me out lol Wow! I love the idea of creating your own app! I should try that one day, thats so interesting! What kind of languages are you using to make it? 
XD Im sorry it scared you, hahahah, have you ever seen any studio ghibli movies? Love Loki, btw.Yep, apps are probably my favorite thing to develop 
Well, it depends on the OS you’re going to create an app for. For Android, you use Java (although Kotlin is now gaining a lot popularity too). And I think you use Swift for iOS.
Lol don’t worry  Nope, I have never watched any studio ghibli movies, but since I’ve been hearing a lot about them I might as well give them a chance soon 
And I’m so happy to know you like Loki too  
(You’re like, the first person I find here that likes something Marvel-related lol)team up with someone who also have same interest, share your experience with themMy interests and ambition is programming. So I chose programming way before. Even though I know some programming languages, It does not mean I master it. Till now i’m a learner, Even if a non experienced  person guides me, I’ll take that as a solution and knowledge. So basically solving problems and creating puzzles are part of it. Daily practice of even 1 hr/day is enough. But you have to make sure you practice a lot. Because I’ve seen people randomly byhearting related codes and working out for days even weeks. It’s full of fun and always feels good to do. We are humans, So that we can’t code all day. But enough hours gives you satisfaction, You’re in the right path."

I’m trying to create an array of unique words (uniqueWords) out of  given array (storyWords). My idea was to iterate forEach() over the original array, passing a function that would compare the two members of the array using includes(). However, it’s not working and I can’t figure it out.
let uniqueWords = [];
storyWords.forEach(      //storyWords is the given array
  function findUnique(word) {
    if (!uniqueWords.includes(word)) {   //is the array member in question in uniqueWords already?
      uniqueWords.push(word);    //if not, push it
    }
  }
  );

when I console.log uniqueWords, it’s empty.

                First question, is it an array of unique words that you want, or an array of all the unduplicated words in the storyWords array?

First question, is it an array of unique words that you want, or an array of all the unduplicated words in the storyWords array?
More to the point of your problem…
forEach takes an anonymous function as a callback. Your function is not anonymous and never gets called. Remove the name and it should work as expected.
Or, move the function to the outside world as a standalone, then reference it in the argument.
Array.forEach(findUnique)Okay, thanks that worked.
I tried it using all the shorthand/anonymous ways but I think I had forgotten to put a semi-colon at the end of the anonymous function. The shorthand syntax is still pretty new for me.I’m particularly fond of the reference approach since it is so straight forward, and it lets us utilize the function it references in many other ways as it is available to the whole program, not just this one forEach. You could even feasibly have several forEach() calls on different arrays that can use the same callback.
The shorthand, or more correctly, concise arrow function syntax is useful when all we want is a simple callback. For more complicated functions, stick to the traditional form.
Above we have an empty list initialized. That makes it awkward to use the standalone since it names the array, explicitly. It will take some reading but forEach permits us to supply that array as one of its arguments. Until such implementation is in place, we might be better to write the callback in the argument.
All kinds of options, and as fledgling programmers, sometimes difficult to choose which one to use. The beauty of programming is we are used to failure since we try so many things we are almost certain won’t work or that we are told to avoid, but we try them anyway.
When you have time, this might be one of those things that is worth exploring for deeper insight and to expand our usage potential of what may prove to be a very powerful feature of the language. Keep us abreast of your exploration so we can play along.Follow-up
This appears to do what we expect, but will need more testing…
Text used
storyWords = 'Once upon a time there was a huge dragon that lived at the top of very tall mountain, so tall its peak was mostly hidden by clouds.'.split(' ')

function findUnique(word) {
  if (!this.includes(word)) {
    this.push(word);
  }
}
let uniqueWords = []
storyWords.forEach(findUnique, uniqueWords);
console.log(uniqueWords)

Output
[ 'Once',
  'upon',
  'a',
  'time',
  'there',
  'was',
  'huge',
  'dragon',
  'that',
  'lived',
  'at',

You use the this.x terminology when you’re passing the array in as the third parameter?


 migueldemaria0134906:

when you’re passing the array in as the third parameter?


As the second argument, yes. That way we don’t have any fixed reference written in the function. It will always (unless we change it) apply to the array we include in the argument. This way the function can be referenced as we described above, by any forEach() regardless of which array it is called on, or passes in.
The only drawback is that our standalone function, as useful as it is as a callback, will not work so well on its own, since this in that sense would be the window object.
A work around for that would be to define a function that not only contains that function, but also contains the forEach.
const findUniqueWords = function(array) {
  function findUnique(word) {
    if (!this.includes(word)) {
      this.push(word)
    }
  }
  const uniques = []
  array.forEach(findUnique, uniques)
  return uniques
}
let uniqueWords = findUniqueWords(storyWords)
console.log(uniqueWords)

Off to test this theory…
Tested and working as expected.Correction… It would be the third argument IF we include an INDEX parameter. And above, word is akin to a block parameter, so don’t mind my mixing up the words. The key is we are learning what each of them represent.FTR, the exercise is located here…

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/mini-linter 1
Yes, I was assuming the index parameter was in there. All of this is very new to me since I just read the docs and it’s a little beyond my level right now.In the spec, anything with a [, in front of it is optional, but the order matters. The example above takes the methodology a bit beyond what this course expects so don’t feel let down if it is hard to grasp. Start from the ground up, along the same lines as you have to this point, and come back to this topic when you’re feeling more confident and have grown your wings. Ping this topic if you ever wish to revive it.In subtask 4 we are asked to count occurrences of “overusedWords”, not occurrence of every specific overused word, so I propose simpler solution than video has provided, check this out and tell me what you think about it:
const howManyOverusedWords = storyWords.filter(word => {
  if(overusedWords.includes(word)) {
     return word;
  };
});

console.log(howManyOverusedWords.length);
It looks viable to me, although I haven’t tested it (also, I never have watched those videos or walkthroughs).
The only thing is I was looking to push myself and that’s why I was working on the “extra credit” assignments. The task of identifying the words used most, and their frequencies, is a challenge. Right at the edge of my abilities… which is a good place to be.Consider,
const howManyOverusedWords = storyWords.filter(word => overusedWords.includes(word)).length;

filter takes a predicate function, so it is already a form of if, especially when we consider the .includes() returns a boolean.
 > a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
<- (9) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 > b = [2,4,6]
<- (3) [2, 4, 6]
 > a.filter(x => b.includes(x)).length
<- 3

733,"A Day in the Life: Jake Hiller, Codecademy Staff Software Engineer","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",1,302,"This month we’re featuring Jake, a long-time Codecademy engineer. At first, Jake didn’t have plans to be a software engineer but with a strong interest in electronics, encouragement from peers, and a lot of perseverance, Jake now finds himself 11 years into a rewarding and fulfilling career as a Software Engineer.
Meet Jake! 
Tell us a little about yourself.
Hi, I’m Jake! I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for 11 years, and I’ve spent the last 5 years as a Front-end Engineer at Codecademy. I’m originally from Philadelphia, and now I live in the New Jersey suburbs, about a 45-minute train ride away from the Codecademy Office in NYC. I went to school for Graphic Design, and my first job was as a Web Designer. While I was there I started to learn Front-end development, and I was hooked immediately. I transitioned to working as an engineer full time and haven’t looked back.
How did you end up working for Codecademy?
In 2011 when Codecademy was launched, I was still learning how to code at my first job, so I created an account and tried it out pretty much immediately. I’m primarily a visual learner, so having an interactive way to learn to code online seemed like a perfect product for me at the time. The fact that Codecademy was trying to teach people in a way that resonated with me personally definitely stuck with me a few years later when I got the opportunity to interview at Codecademy.
Did you always want to be a Staff Software Engineer?
As a kid I always loved electronics, video games, and tinkering with all kinds of hardware and software, but I didn’t consider turning those hobbies into a career until after School. I was never a strong math student, and even though I spent a lot of time working with computers, the idea that I could be a software engineer never really seemed possible to me. Even when I got started building websites at my first job, it took me a long time to accept that I could do it. I was lucky to have mentors and friends at the company who saw that I had potential and encouraged me.
As far as being a Staff Engineer, I don’t think I really knew that role existed until I got my first job at a bigger company. The Engineers with the Staff title there were some of the most knowledgeable on the team, they were the engineers you were told to ask if you had a question on a certain topic, and they were always the ones you wanted constructive criticism from when you were writing a technical plan for a project. They would have that extra bit of context on the architecture of the site that could help you steer your project in the right direction.
I think having positive experiences with that role early in my career led me to aspire to take on that role when I gained more experience. Titles and responsibilities are all very different between companies, so it’s hard to say this is what “Staff” means on every team, or if they even have that title, but I think there are similar expectations for knowledge sharing and mentorship on more senior members of any engineering team.
What are the best aspects about working as a Staff Software Engineer?
As a Staff Software Engineer, I get to work on a wide variety of projects, and collaborate with all of the different product and engineering teams across the company. I’ve always loved the problem solving aspect of programming, so getting to spend a lot of my time with the team helping to solve different problems is really the best part of the job for me. I also really enjoy working with some of the more junior members on the team and helping them grow however I can. I try to welcome teammates to ask questions and propose solutions that might contradict my own view. Regardless of where someone is in their career I always feel like there’s something to learn from someone, often much more than you think.
What are the worst aspects about working as a Staff Software Engineer?
Dealing with ambiguity. Especially working on an engineering-driven team, I’m often being asked to figure out what the problems are AND propose solutions to them. It’s difficult to know where to start, and then, even if you know what to do, whether to prioritize that project over a thousand other things you know need to get done eventually. I’ve found that I always need to find collaborators on the team that I work well with and trust to bounce ideas off of and give me the extra confidence to make decisions.
If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?
Wow, there are so many things. It would be too safe to pick something that would solve world hunger or reverse global warming, so I’ll pick something fun. It’s so common in sci-fi movies that I barely notice it anymore, but I’ve always loved the idea of the personal spaceship. Having a small ship in the backyard ready to take me literally anywhere in the universe whenever I want seems like an amazing amount of freedom.
Do you have any advice for the learners?
My main advice is to not give up. Engineers at every level get stuck constantly. The lightbulb moment when you feel defeated and finally “get it” is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an engineer.
If you could make one brand new course what would it be?
I would make something simple and visually oriented that gets people that maybe don’t think they have the aptitude to become an engineer to see how so many of the skills they already have apply to engineering. I love when we put out courses on more complex technologies and new languages, but what really interests me is getting new people excited about coding.
What does a typical day look like for you?
I loved working in the office, but I’ve been working from home one or two days a week for the last few years. Luckily because of that I already had an office space set up when we transitioned to remote full time. Having a private space where I can get into work-mode is really helpful for me, especially for video calls.
Our team usually has a standup meeting around 11:30AM. At that point I’ve had enough time to figure out what I need to be working on, if I need to coordinate with my teammates on something, or if there are any new meetings that have popped up that I need to set aside time to prepare for.
Here are some of the things I end up doing on a daily basis:

General programming work for any of the projects or tasks I’m working on
Lots of code review for my teammates and other engineers throughout the team
Technical design meetings & check-ins on projects
Responding to other requests & issues that come up throughout the day
Meeting with other departments like Design to discuss collaborative frontend projects
Various meetings from other teams, presentations by engineers on interesting new projects or topics
Interviewing (intermittently, depending on our hiring plans)

there is no way to shortcut experience and practice.
Just get started and see if its challenging enough/you learn enough, otherwise find something more challenging. This image came to mind based on your question:



 stetim94:

Are you having a rough day or do you personally not like the question? I didn’t see an answer when I did a search through the forum to answer this question
For example
No, Codecademy will not be enough education or training to be job-ready. Codecademy is only enough to give you a foundation from there you will need to read this book… take these other training courses… as well Codecademy’s sample projects we make you do are not enough, you will also need to develop other projects like…



 stetim94:

Just get started and see if its challenging enough/you learn enough, otherwise find something more challenging. This image came to mind based on your question:


I guess you did not understand my question and actually proved my point about regarding being strategic. To give you an analogy that you relate to coding. This is like me as a client saying I need a website created. You as the developer saying “Ok, without asking me any questions or scoping out what I am using the website for, what colours I want, what images…etc.” Then designing a website and coming back to me saying “What do you think about this one…” me telling you that is not right and you and I go back and forth wasting a lot of time versus if you would have scoped out the project it would be more efficient and the project would be completed in a shorter amount of time.
a more accurate quote is “you fail to plan you plan to fail”
.I think what @stetim94 is trying to say here is that this question has already been answered multiple times (go ahead and search it), and he doesn’t want to answer it again. Which makes sense to me… I would advise going ahead and seeing if the answer is already posted on the forums; if not then you can come back here.



 stetim94:

Basically, look at the course estimation of how long it is. That’s about how long it will take, and there is no getting around that if you actually want to learn. If you have 5-7 hours a week free to devote to the course, then you’ll actually learn something, but don’t go looking for ways to do this course quicker(I’m specifically thinking of the Python 3 which is 25 hours long).
For course recommendations, I would advise taking the Python 3 course(if you don’t have Pro like me, take Python 2 instead). This course will take you from the fundamentals to the more advanced and will teach you most of the stuff you need to know. You said that you don’t have a whole lot of time and I can totally understand that. Unfortunately, there(like I said before) is no shortcut. If you want to learn Python, you have to devote a lot of time to it.
Hope this Helps!Thanks @stevencopeland for your response.
I did do a search and as I mentioned I wasn’t able to find a detailed answer regarding Python as I provided an example. Don’t get me wrong I might have missed it but from my search I wasn’t able to find a detailed answer to provide that type of insight.
I think there I might not be clear “I need to be strategic with my time and courses because I don’t have much free time.” Let me clarify. “I need to be strategic with my time” meaning I have about 1 hour a night to studying Python programming and with all the resources, books, online courses, YouTube videos I don’t have the time to do a trial and error to try to figure out what might be a good resource to learn from. Also, without knowing Python programming at all, knowing what is a good resource. They all might sound good to me but end up being either to advanced, too technical…etc This could take months with the limited amount of time I have just to figure out what is a good resource/training. Now doing a Google search I have found different books and online courses but they seem subjective on which one to start with. Codecademy has come up as a good starting point. I just want to make sure that I am not spending 3 months on Codecademy and find out that I took the wrong program in Codecademy. I should have taken another program that would have provided the education I needed which is now going to be another 3 months to 6 months.  So it’s not how fast, it’s more not picking the wrong resource and finding out I personally choose the wrong resource/training and waisted my own time.
I am sure we have all been there through IT. We get one book read through it and it’s good, but then you find another resource which you wish you would have started with because it covered everything in the first resource and do so much more.
I agree with you I know learning Python will take work and time. I planning the next 6 months to 1 year just to get the basics down. I appreciate how much work it takes.
Quick question, what about the “Full Catalog” the Computer Science or Data Science programs? Would they not be a better path to take?


 brandonkr:

So it’s not how fast, it’s more not picking the wrong resource and finding out I personally choose the wrong resource/training and waisted my own time.


Oh, I see what you mean… I can understand why you’d want to pick the right topic then!



 brandonkr:

Quick question, what about the “Full Catalog” the Computer Science or Data Science programs? Would they not be a better path to take?


I think so, because those paths are completely dedicated to learning python(or at least the computer science one is), and they’ll take you on a deeper dive than just the regular python course. The reason I didn’t recommend those was because I hesitate to recommend paths without knowing whether you are a Pro user. But if you are, I definitely recommend taking the path that says it will teach you what you want to know.yeah I have made that mistake before on different IT topics and spent months on learning. Then someone pop’s up and mentions a better resource.
Yeah I have no problem paying for the Pro course as long as like you understand I’m going to get a good foundation to be able to apply after I’m done. I do appreciate it’s only the beginning and there is so much more to learn. I just want to make sure once I’m finished this program I can hit the ground running and start working, even if it’s smaller projects and jobs I don’t care, just as long as I can start working.
To be honest I’m doing this for a few reasons


I work in Cybersecurity sales and my job is very volatile. If I don’t hit my numbers I get let go. So I want to work on programming now while I’m working so that I have options if I am out of work.


I have heard rumours that Python is used in Cybersecurity for pentesting, scripting, data analytics…etc so working on this skill now I feel will help me with job security later. Either finding a job or free lancing. This way I’m truly never out of work.


This is why I am planning this out and trying to be mindful of my time because while I am doing this I am also working and learning about Cybersecurity i.e. CISSP, NDR, EDR, SIEM, IAM, PAM…etcI was going to reply here and ask “Why Python?”, but I think you’ve covered this off pretty well here…

Python, as a language, is getting continually more popular because it’s versatile and pretty ■■■■ powerful. You can do a lot with it, and it’s certainly useful in the cybersecurity space.
That being said, cybersecurity is a pretty broad field. I’d say that Python is certainly not a bad place to start, and it’s a very straightforward language to learn as a beginner.
I don’t think, though, that you’re asking - or we’re answering - the right question.
Before we get to the question of whether, or how and where, you ought to learn Python, it would be a good idea for you to ask yourself another question - what do I want to be doing in cybersecurity?
For example do you want to be working for a cybersecurity firm, carrying out pen tests or vulnerability analysis for the firm’s customers? Perhaps you’d prefer to be in an analyst position, working in a SOC and keeping everything as secure as possible? Or do you envision yourself as a bug hunter, tracking down as-yet-undiscovered flaws or exploits in other peoples code?
If you know what you want to achieve, we can probably give you better advice on how to get there.
Equally, if you’re not aiming to end up in the cybersecurity space but you just want to get work as a developer, knowing that means we can advise accordingly. 



 brandonkr:

while I am doing this I am also working and learning about Cybersecurity i.e. CISSP


There are other cybersec qualifications besides the CISSP, and it’s not a cert for everyone! Good question, I am working towards managerial/consulting roles for Cybersecurity because my position is “Cybersecurity Account Manager” but the company I am working for is more hunting than farming. So I’m doing more cold calls and building up opportunities. The past company I worked for I was doing more account managing which was going through a advisory role and helping accounts with their Cybersecurity solutions. I am working towards more of that role. While having a back-up on a technical side this way if anything happens I have a technical background that I have developed that I can use. I use to be in IT support so it’s in my wheel house just haven’t been doing much of it in the past 4 years. That is why I wanted to focus on Python programming like you mentioned, over time if I can develop the skills needed in Python it will still keep me in the Cybersecurity industry just in a different way. What interest me is pen testing, AI and machine learning. Seeing these new technologies coming out more is interesting to see how they work.
Right now I want to get a strong foundation with Python so that I can understand the language. Once I have that foundation then look at what directly I want to take Python.
Yes, I agree there are many different cybersec certification/qualification. I am just going for the CISSP currently because it holds a little weight in the consulting/managerial side of Cybersecurity when speaking to Directors, VP’s, C-Suite people as I’m sure you know.


 brandonkr:

With regards to the pen testing aspect, if you’re thinking of getting in with a consultancy firm and running the tests against customer infrastructure then quite a lot of it likely relies on pre-built kit. Stuff like Kali, as well as the myriad frameworks for prodding various things, would be good to look into alongside the Python.
Important note: It should be obvious, but don’t point any security tools - however innocuous or “harmless” you think they are - at other people’s gear without prior, well documented, permission. (@brandonkr I assume you know this, so it’s more for anyone else who might read this down the line. )
Python on its own probably wouldn’t set you up to go properly bug hunting, though, if you were thinking of going fishing for zero-days.



 brandonkr:

Right now I want to get a strong foundation with Python so that I can understand the language. Once I have that foundation then look at what directly I want to take Python.


Either of the Python courses - Python 3 is a Pro only course, I think - or the Comp Sci Path would probably be good for that. I haven’t done any of the Paths, but the standalone language courses cover the basics to a good extent. I’d couple it with stuff like CodeWars, getting familiar with the Python Docs, and books.



 brandonkr:

I am just going for the CISSP currently because it holds a little weight in the consulting/managerial side of Cybersecurity when speaking to Directors, VP’s, C-Suite people as I’m sure you know.


CISSP is a well regarded cert, for sure. You should keep in mind, though, that the passing the CISSP exam is only part of the journey.
CISSP requires you to have 5 years or more of paid work experience across at least 2 of the 8 knowledge areas. (A relevant 4-year degree course, or certain other professional certifications in relevant areas, can be counted as one year of experience.)
Even then, you don’t get the full CISSP until your work experience has been checked and verified by someone else who’s already accredited by (ISC)2… so it’s not an easy cert to get, but I think that’s part of why the CISSP (as well as the other (ISC)2 certs) are well regarded!oh for sure there is much more to pen testing then just knowing how to code. I just want to get the Python foundation because it gives me options.
I sat beside two pen testings for 6 months and asked lots of questions. Even between them both they had different skill sets.
On my list of books to buy are these two once I learn the foundation of Python first.
Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters 3

Very good point to make because too many people start pointing tools at areas they shouldn’t and even though they are just learning there is legal repercussions. As well the effects you can have on what you are pointing at can be severe and cause an outage and maybe worse.
As for the CISSP I totally agree it’s only the start, as you know we never stop learning and developing.
I have about 4 years of paid work experience across a few of the domains and I have a certification that knocks off a year. When I take the exam and pass I would be a CISSP Associate until I was able to get the full 5 years of work experience which wouldn’t take me that long working in the industry now… I hope. Once you pass the exam you have 6 years to get the 5 years of experience. I would just need 1 maybe, 2 years depending on what they accept.
I worked with and know a few CISSP’s who I have already asked if they would be my sponsor. They know what I have done and would be willing to be my sponsor. Thank you for reminding me of what needs to be achieved.


 brandonkr:

On my list of books to buy are these two once I learn the foundation of Python first.
Black Hat Python: Python Programming for Hackers and Pentesters


No Starch books are pretty good, tbh. 



 brandonkr:

I sat beside two pen testings for 6 months and asked lots of questions. Even between them both they had different skill sets.


Good.  They’ll likely be able to recommend some good learning resources to you, as well.

I have about 4 years of paid work experience across a few of the domains and I have a certification that knocks off a year. … Once you pass the exam you have 6 years to get the 5 years of experience. I would just need 1 maybe, 2 years depending on what they accept.


Hopefully that wouldn’t be too tricky, especially as you’re already working for a company in the sector.

Tbh, sounds like you’ve got the hard bit sorted.
Going back to the question at hand, then - learning Python. If you’re wanting to test the water a bit, the Python 2 course doesn’t need a Pro sub. There’s some differences between Python 2 and 3, but tbh they’re not huge. The Python 2 course, without Pro, covers the basics and can be done quite quickly - though, obviously, people learn at different rates etc .
If you get on well with the Python 2 stuff, you can go Pro after that and do the Python 3 or Comp Sci path. The CS path covers more advanced topics than the standalone Python course, and I think there’s some overlap. It’d definitely get you flexing the sort of problem solving you’d need, though. Once you’ve got that, tbh, other languages are easy… if you needed them. Good to know you recommend the Starch books.
yeah they were talking about OSCP and work towards that if I want to do pen testing.
I hope not, the good thing is this is the career I enjoy just need to get some more foundation.
hmm Python 2 or Python 3 or Computer Science path. I’m debating about doing the Computer Science path to give me a good strong foundation in the mindset of a programmer while learning Python to a level that it appears I can use once the 20 weeks completed. I’m not to worried about the investment because I am using to paying for courses, books, resources…etc. I just make sure it is worth the investment and I will be able to make my money back after I am done. As you know when you get some certifications you either ask for a raise at work or start looking for a different job that will pay you more for your knowledge.
Thank you @thepitycoder this conversation has been very helpful. Now it’s time to do the hard part and do the work. Planning is easy, doing the work is hard.I would also love to hear from someone who has no programming background who took the “Computer Science path” and their experience afterwards. Did they start working? Or did they feel they didn’t know much and had so much more to learn?..etc.Lucky you, i stumbled with this post the same day i finished Comp Sci path without prior coding experience.
Well, everyone’s experience is different. Im planning to learn enough programming to make a career change next year, and the Comp Sci path gave me a very good understanding about programming.
I can just say i’m glad i took this course because they lead you through core concepts of programming (data structures, search algorithms, Big O Notation, etc). Everything is python-focused so you will be fine since you want to learn Python.
What is a Programming Language without real applications anyway? go for it.Hey @corotox thank you for your response. How do you feel after completing the Computer Science Path. Have you been working on projects do you feel you have a good base?I’m doing beginner projects (the ones posted with the name “Comp Sci independent project” on this forum). I did project 1 and its posted here too. I’m doing right now project #2 blackjack. To be honest, i should have done these projects a while ago, but i was so focused learning that i postponed them).
I will be doing a lot of practice right now to help me retain most concepts possible, i think i would be able to provide better feedback regarding projects in the short-mid term (1 month, 2?). I will ensure to post them here in the forums to help other learners and ofc help myself when feedback comes.
So right now, practice-related i’m at beginner level. Ofc i did all the projects through the Comp Sci path, they are focused on teaching and give you directions, which is fine. But since you won’t have such help in real life it’s key to start building projects on your own.
I should have started practicing before, but well, i’m self learning so i just learned that practice is as important as grabbing new concepts haha. Anyway, there is a ton of resources that will surely help me in projects, but at this point, i feel that it will be more superficial, because I already have a better understanding of programming. It is much simpler when you know what you are looking for.Thanks @corotox I would appreciate your insight after you get a few months of practice under your belt. From what you shared it sounds like you recommend to do the projects as you go through the course to get the most out of the course and the time.
From my understanding, most people are repetitive learners so the more you do something the faster you retain it.
Thank you for sharing your experience.If you want to learn Python, there are basically two ways. You can learn it by the online courses or by reading books. Actually, I have a little bit idea about online courses and so I don’t want to recommend you any course about it. But I personally read a lot of books about Python. If you want to buy books, you will face difficulty because there are a huge range of similar books in the market. In my experience, I want to recommend you to read Python Crash Course 4. It will teach you-

Basic programming concepts, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, and loops
How to make your programs interactive and test your code safely before adding it to a project
To work with Python libraries and tools, including matplotlib, NumPy, and Pygal
A Space Invaders-inspired arcade game
Data visualizations with Python’s super-handy libraries
A simple web app you can deploy online
Deal with mistakes and errors so you can solve your own programming problems



 cloud1618643214:

You can learn it by the online courses or by reading books.


Why would it be an either/or situation? I originally learned the basics of Python 2 here at Codecademy… I now have a considerable number of programming related books to supplement the resource here at Codecademy.
In short, any educational material - whether online, print, or something else - is useful and valuable.

I am a big fan of the No Starch books. "
737,Add the numbered bookmark-bar back to the top of the career path to prevent of miles of scrolling,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,133,"With the new layout for the career path (and maybe the skill path as well) the numbered bookmarks / progress bar at the top of the path has disappeared. Now that I’m at 60%, I have to scroll down quite a while before I get to the module and lesson I’m currently on. Especially because there is no way anymore to collapse the contents of the other modules that I already passed.
I know that I can ‘resume’ my course with on click from the dashboard to get me straight to where I was working. But it’s nice to be able to easily access the scope of the entire module (not just the current lesson) to see what came before and what is still coming.
And to me personally it was also motivating to see those numbers at the top ticked off as I progressed through the content of the pathHi @silvith. Thanks for the feedback, you call out some really great points. I’m reading that 1) it was gratifying to have your progress be very apparent (ie. progress circles up top) and 2) a tighter layout (ie. being able to expand/collapse modules) felt easier to manage when you get back to resume the career path you were working on. And without either of those two things made simple, it’s a not-so-great user experience. Did I read into that correctly?
I’ll be sure to send your feedback to our product team ASAP. In the meantime, let me know if I’m missing anything here so I can be sure to surface your feedback accurately.Hi @lilibird Thanks for your reply.
I personally don’t mind terribly much that the modules can’t collapse. It’s more the lack of bookmarks at the top now, which results in lots of scrolling when I want to get an overview of the module I’m currently in."
738,Meal Maker course needs work,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,2,133,"Hi, I just finished this project (whew) and although it has some potential, I think it was unnecessarily hard and needs some tweaking.
For one, it asked us to create a bunch of getter/setter functions which weren’t ever used in the project. That just confused what was already a pretty decent step up in difficulty.
Secondly and much worse, is that the hints were actively incorrect and misleading. Instead of using the right verbiage, the hints used similar words, leading me to try to use those words. Worse than that even, is that some steps were skipped. For example, the hint might suggest this.appetizer when it was actually this._course.appetizer. At least it seems that way to me.
I think it would have been a lot less confusing if the hints were either clearly not related to the project, but similar examples/patterns, or else were, well, correct.
Another niggle is that some of the variable names recommended by the directions were not very helpful and in fact confusing.
Besides that, the project itself was rather complicated, definitely complicated enough that these other factors made it difficult–but not in a good way difficult (IMO). And I see lots of other people have had issues with the project. It would be a really good one, again IMO, with a few tweaks.


 migueldemaria0134906:

this.appetizer when it was actually this._course.appetizer.


Valid points. As to the above, the difference might well be of context. If the getters/setters are inside the _courses object body then the former would apply. I’ve not seen many written that way though. Most are as you describe, outside of the _courses object, so in menu context.
We’ll refer this to the curriculum team for review and possible revision. Only thing is there is a walk through video that would have to be revised to match the changes made in the course. This could take months to implement.Thanks for taking a look.  I saw a lot of people were having problems, so I thought I’d chime in. I ended up tossing out my first attempt and starting fresh, forgoing all the getter functions to simplify things, and test and log at each step. So it wasn’t a bad thing for me to do by any means."
739,[Article] Top 10 HTML5 Questions,Featured Challenges and Events,2,2.1k,"Introduction
This article is for people who want to prepare themselves for a job interview, or for people who wish to test their HTML mastery and learn new skills. Here we will discuss the top ten HTML5 questions asked in interviews and we will provide each one with a concise and clean answer.

What’s new HTML 5 DocType and Charset?
How can we embed Audio in HTML 5?
How can we embed Video in HTML 5?
What are the new media elements in HTML 5 other than audio and video?
What is the usage of canvas Element in HTML 5?
What are the different types of storage in HTML 5?
What are the new Form Elements introduced in HTML 5?
What are the deprecated Elements in HTML5 from HTML4?
What are the new APIs provided by HTML 5 standard?
What is the difference between HTML 5 Application Cache and regular HTML Browser Cache?

By the end of the article, you should have a grasp on your main HTML weaknesses. Then it’s only up to you to improve them and become a better coder.  Also, don’t forget to check the sources section, where you’ll find more links and information to help you complement what you’ve learned in the questions.
Questions
1. What’s new HTML 5 DocType and Charset?
As HTML 5 is now not a subset of SGML, its DocType is simplified as follows:
<!doctype html>

And HTML 5 uses UTF-8 encoding as follows:
<meta charset=""UTF-8"">

2. How can we embed Audio in HTML 5?
HTML 5 comes with a standard way of embedding audio files. Supported audio formats are MP3, Wav and Ogg.
<audio controls>
<source src=""jamshed.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg"">
Your browser doesn't support audio embedding feature.
</audio>

3. How can we embed Video in HTML 5?
Same like audio, HTML 5 defined standard way of embedding video files. Supported video formats are MP4, WebM and Ogg.
<video width=""450"" height=""340"" controls>
<source src=""jamshed.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"">
Your browser does'nt support video embedding feature.
</video>

4. What are the new media elements in HTML 5 other than audio and video?
HTML 5 has strong support for media. Other than audio and video tags, it comes with the following tags:


<embed>  acts as a container for external application.

<track>  defines text track for media.

<source>  is helpful for multiple media sources for audio and video.

5. What is the usage of canvas Element in HTML 5?
<canvas>  is an element in HTML5 which we can use to draw graphics with the help of scripting (which is most probably JavaScript). This element behaves like a container for graphics and rest of the things will be done by scripting. We can draw images, graphs and a bit of animations etc. using  <canvas>  element.
<canvas id=""canvas1"" width=""300"" height=""100"">
</canvas>

6. What are the different types of storage in HTML 5?
HTML 5 has the capability to store data locally. Previously, it was done with the help of cookies. The exciting thing about this storage is that it’s fast as well as secure.
There are two different objects which can be used to store data:

localStorage object stores data for a longer period of time even if the browser is closed.
sessionStorage object stores data for a specific session.

7. What are the new Form Elements introduced in HTML 5?
There are a number of new form elements that have been introduced in HTML 5 as follows:

datalist
datetime
output
keygen
date
month
week
time
number
range
email
url

8. What are the deprecated Elements in HTML5 from HTML4?
Elements that are deprecated from HTML 4 to HTML 5 are:

frame
frameset
noframe
applet
big
center
basefront

9. What are the new APIs provided by HTML 5 standard?
HTML 5 standard comes with a number of new APIs. Few of them are as follows:

Media API
Text Track API
Application Cache API
User Interaction
Data Transfer API
Command API
Constraint Validation API
History API and many more…

10. What is the difference between HTML 5 Application Cache and regular HTML Browser Cache?
One of the key features of HTML 5 is “Application Cache” that enables us to make an offline version of a web application. It allows to fetch few or all of website contents such as HTML files, CSS, images, JavaScript, etc. locally. This feature speeds up the site performance. This is achieved with the help of a manifest file defined as follows:
<!doctype html>
<html manifest=""example.appcache"">
.....
</html>

As compared with traditional browser caching, it’s not compulsory for the user to visit website contents to be cached.
Conclusion
Hopefully by now you acquired some taste of what an employer might ask in an interview. Even if that was not your goal, I am quite sure that learning how to add video and sound to your HTML documents will make everything a lot cooler. Still, feel free to make suggestions, we are always open to improvements!

740,Lua on Codecademy,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,1,133,"Lua is literally the second most voted topic on the course poll. It’s the only coding language I want to learn right now and y’all are hiding behind languages like “kotlin”. Come on, step up your game.

741,Daily Code Challenges thanks to DEV,Tips and Resources,0,151,"Are you familiar with DEV? From their own site (read more about them here 3:

DEV is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out. The software industry relies on collaboration and networked learning. We provide a place for that to happen.

Turns out, they’ve been posting daily code challenges from CodeWars for the past 8 months or so. Which means… there are a lot of challenges to practice!  . Here’s the latest one (June 10th):
Write function smaller(arr) that given an array arr, 
you have to return the amount of numbers that are 
smaller to the right of that number in the index.

For example:
smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
smaller([1, 2, 0]) === [1, 1, 0]

Tests:
smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
smaller([1, 2, 3])
smaller([1, 1, -1, 0, 0])
smaller([5, 4, 7, 9, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6])

744,"So… YOU WANT TO WORK IN (web) DEVELOPMENT, or as a PROGRAMMER, or in some way WORK IN IT? Read This First!","Careers, Journeys, and Stories",6,1.4k,"So… YOU WANT TO WORK IN (web) DEVELOPMENT, or as a PROGRAMMER, or in some way WORK IN IT?   Read on…
STEP 1 - The first step is to spend some time doing research to determine what you enjoy.  WHY?  Because, the process of mastering skills in programming & development and then later working in the field requires - on a daily basis - absorbing tons of concepts, staring at a screen for hours, writing 1000s of lines of code, testing, debugging, re-factoring, making things pretty, etc, so a key factor is to HAVE FUN doing what you like, and want to do, and then everything will fall into place.
For example, MOST PEOPLE DO THIS > if you enjoy working on front end web applications then explore HTML, CSS, Javascript technologies & libraries, UI, UX, etc.  Mastering Data Science is a great career move, but a prerequisite is the ability to program in Python, and leveraging Python to clean, massage, manipulate, & organize tons of data, and then later succinctly communicate your findings to appropriate audiences.  If you like working with Microsoft technologies then research C#, ASP. .NET, etc.  If you’re more of a behind the scenes type, where content & logic is processed on a server, then research frameworks like Django & Flask (Python based), Node (Javascript based), PHP/Apache, Ruby/Rails, etc.  If you’d like to develop mobile apps for iPhones then look at iOS, or Android for all others.  React Native might also be good for the latter.
The Code Foundations Career Path on Codecademy can help you make this determination.  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/code-foundations 35
STEP 2 - Once you determine what you enjoy, the second step is to determine what goal(s) or objectives you’d like to achieve.  Things like “joining a team as a junior developer”, “joining the Data Analytics department of a company”, “developing websites for small businesses and mom & pop shops”, “programming desktop or mobile applications”.  WHY?  This sets an overarching target to work towards.
STEP 3 - Once you have a clear picture of what you enjoy (step 1), and your goals (step 2), the third step is to implement a learning plan, based on small sub-steps, all of which support and lead to obtaining your ultimate goal(s).  WHY?  You’re instilling structure and responsibility into your life, in bite-size, manageable chunks.  Codecademy incorporates learning plans pre-built into Career Paths & Skill Paths.  https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all 7
STEP 4 - Now that all of the above is in place, you need to focus, work hard, build things, fix and prettify your work, never give up, and never stop learning.  Repetition is the key.  When you can confidently apply the concepts you’ve learned, importantly are able to articulate them, and feel ready to enter the workforce with your valuable skills, start applying for jobs.  This might be a stressful cycle because some/many jobs you apply to may result in rejection, but know that EVERYONE experiences this.  Consider it a learning experience, stay positive, and move on to the next.  You should develop a portfolio to show off your skills so spend a few weeks doing this and then apply again for more jobs.  Also have your projects committed to GitHub - employers like to see lots of Github activity.  Tweak your resume.  Apply again.  During this job search, never give up, and never feel complacent or despondent.  And… never stop learning.  Always continue coding, practicing, refreshing your skills, and learning new things to land that job.
Some people after ONLY A FEW MONTHS of learning how to code were offered positions in major companies, and changed their lives for the best and better.  Review and apply the steps stated in this post because YOU CAN DO IT and YOU WILL ACHIEVE SUCCESS.
NOT A STEP!! If you don’t know what you enjoy (step 1), where you want to be (step 2), and a clear plan to get there (step 3), it might be extremely unproductive, not to mention a waste of time & money, to haphazardly take a bunch of courses ad hoc at random, leading you astray.Thanks for posting! This was really helpful.Thank you for your post. You mention at the end that “some people after only a few months of learning how to code were offered positions in major companies” is that really true? I ask because isn’t learning to program/code extremely challenging and takes some time to really get a good strong foundation with?@ brandonkr - it is absolutely true - there’s 1000s of success stories you can find online, within Codecademy, and other schools.Do you have any examples @Lazer300 because what you can see online sometimes are more marketing vs reality.Thanks for the share @ brandonkr - they’re real - IT is a trillion $$$$ industry and there’s a part in it for everyone to play.  You can easily find many of  your own success stories and also easily discern what is genuine versus marketing hype.  But there’s no success without determination, hard work, & perseverance.  Asking others to do your research demonstrates lack of determination and belief in yourself.
Just yesterday I spent around an hour listening to & reviewing & learning from another guy’s success story - he previously failed as a programmer, tried again, was rejected many times, and now he helps others - like me.  A few weeks ago I reviewed another success story of a guy that was actually homeless, used the computer at a public library, finally got the money to buy his own laptop, and then got a great job.  Every so often I do this because it’s inspiring and impressive.
Do you seriously think so many examples of people putting their extremely PERSONAL experiences out there for everyone to see is marketing?"
745,Is having mental block common when learning code?,Community,6,146,"hi! i hope the forum is open to random questions like this.
I am new to code academy and been using it for a week and a bit to learn python3 and get something under my belt and get a foot in coding. I do have some minor learning difficulties and i understand that i will struggle to understand some things but when i have something down i generally have it.
Is it common to be able to do something one day and just struggle and forget the next? i feel like i just have an off day where i feel incapable of understanding something or i just cant remember how to structure things. I have no idea if this is common or not i just wondered if other people get like this and what they do to get back on track.
Thanks Welcome, @itsnathanlevi ! 



 itsnathanlevi:

Is it common to be able to do something one day and just struggle and forget the next? i


Absolutely. And, that’s okay!   I don’t have a scientific study, but, I’m pretty sure that everyone experiences this at one point or another. Roadblocks are common when learning a new concept or debugging code. Coding is challenging. (It’s not my background). Taking breaks is necessary sometimes. So, walk away from your computer and do something else. For me, I find that if I work my brain in a different way–baking, crocheting, taking a walk, a solution comes to me, or I can understand a concept that I had been struggling with.
Practice & repetition helps when learning to code. Try to not get discouraged! If you get stuck, search the help forums here for guidance or post a new question. Because odds are, you aren’t the only one who has had an issue.Hello @itsnathanlevi. To add onto what @lisalisaj said, try to some mini-projects (either ones from CC, the Internet or your head). This really does help you to consolidate the information, and also lets you find any particular areas of coding that you’re stuck on.
Happy coding!Thanks guys! it’s great to hear i am not alone with feeling like sometimes i am just outright stuck. as a question is it ok to not really be good at the maths side of coding and using google to sometimes help you get to an answer or help with getting a general grasp on things?
I have been trying to google some things i am unsure of or that i see within the videos that are supplied in the course by teachers and googling things to understand some things i never learnt like string formatting and other functions.
@lisalisaj & @codeneutrino thank you so much for the feedback and letting me know it happens to more than just me!
I have ideas of projects i just find my scope bigger than what i am capable of right now so i will try find mini projects around on the internet! Google is your friend. I think that’s a skill that isn’t necessarily taught to people who are learning to code–how and where to find information when you’re stuck.
So, good on you for seeking out info. 



 itsnathanlevi:

is it ok to not really be good at the maths side of coding and using google to sometimes help you get to an answer or help with getting a general grasp on things?


tbh, I’m not really a “math person” either, even though I wish I was  (always did poorly in math classes when I was younger. Perhaps it’s because I had terrible teachers(?)) BUT, the only math that really made sense to me and that I did well in was statistics. Go figure! I had an excellent professor in grad school and I was studying something that mattered to me–sociology & stats made sense. 
The way to solidify concepts that you’re learning is to pick a subject that interests you and do a side project. Start small and work up to larger projects.what i tend to find myself doing is commenting my way through in hopes it helps commit some of what i am doing to memory. I am not sure if it is actually helping but is it something you think i should keep trying to do in order to understand it a bit better?
example.
#Write your function here
def same_values(lst1,lst2):
  newlist = []
  # for index in the (range of (the length of(list1)))
  for index in range(len(lst1)):
    # if lst1(index) is equal to lst2(index) [] = list index = [0:] 
    if lst1[index] == lst2[index]:
      # append 'index' to newlist
      newlist.append(index)
  # Return newlist value 
  return newlist
#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5]))
If it helps you understand, then absolutely do it."

Did you learn something new from an online webinar?


Did you finish a project or lesson?


Did you help someone else understand a concept?


Excited to read about everyone’s win! Mine?
I tweaked some code that I had written in Python, making an API request and I didn’t break it.
I wasn’t too nervous & managed to sound knowledgeable when I recorded myself answering questions for a behavioral interview for a job I’d applied to.I completed a form validation project using JavaScript. I’m starting to understand how to navigate through the DOM.I finally got around to setting up Visual Studio Code as my text editor. It makes things so much easier I’ve been using VSCode for ages, albeit with the Atom keymap extension (because I used Atom for a while beforehand and the keyboard shortcuts stuck).
I’ve had two wins this week:


Finally got over the last few hurdles keeping me from deploying a web app to Azure.


Applied the concepts from the Requests II 1 lesson to building a small web app that interacts with an API for a system at work. I now have a small dashboard for automating some otherwise very repetitive tasks, but which will save me (and my colleagues) a good amount of time in future. 

I was finally able to install and import Matplotlib in my Jupyter Notebook in my own Laptop. Conda didn’t worked for me don’t know why but pip install worked like a charm… I was trying to run from soo many days and finally today it worked.   
I just finished 30% of Computer Science course and finished some challenges project.

Does anyone else find these projects to be counter-productive? Given 0-100 difficulty level (100 being the most difficult). Every prior task section seems to go from around level 20-30 then BAM! The projects are up at 95-100.
I have not finished a single one of these projects by myself. And even after forum searches, MDN and video walkthroughs I don’t think I’ve learned anything from any of these projects. In fact, it has made me all the more frustrated and utterly confused because there is no clear understanding of why the code works. And mostly very vague explanations.
I know that it can’t be all laid out etc etc. But there just seems to be a giant, counter-productive gap between task sections and project sections. I spent around 9 hours (over 3 days) on one project and I don’t think I took anything informative from it at all. Just more confusion. It seemed like the biggest waste of time.
So, what am I missing? IQ points?
Thanks.This is how I see it:
Regular lessons are there to teach you some concepts and code. And projects make you analyze “real life” situations to see how you would translate them into code (which is a very valuable skill to have, if you ask me).
They do have less guidance, though. If I’m feeling stuck on a project and decide to check the hint, all it will give me is a piece of code with no proper explanation 
And yeah, I have been stuck on a project for TOO much time, many times. But as long as I’m able to re-focus and re-read my code from a different perspective, I’ll get through it. I almost never have trouble with coding knowledge needed for a project; what will make my brain sweat is adapting that knowledge to the situation I’m working on
My point is, I don’t think projects mean to teach us any new coding stuff. Instead, I see them as a way of exercising our brain muscle to translate real life problems to code."

756,Web spider path,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",2,190,"Hi,
I know what I want to make, but don’t have any coding background. In other words, I don’t know what I don’t know.
I’d like to make a web spider to crawl the internet. The spider should then index sites that have a certain technology. For example, ‘show me all the sites in the world hosting Shopify’. Those sites should then be exported to CSV.
I’m looking at Python & Scrapy. But I don’t know what else I’ll need. Any thoughts on what modules I’ll need in Codecademy to make this journey as smooth and direct as possible?
Thanks!!The code for this can actually be super simple depending on the ambition of this project you have in mind. If that path makes the most sense, I don’t have time to do a freelance contract FOR you …at least not FOR free.
Doing this for fun or a learning exercise?
I think this is a great choice for a fun project! …and there are lots of google-able tutorials to building a web scraper. The toughest thing behind the technical design will be deciding how specific you want to get about what web technologies are being used for a site, and what defining criteria you’ll be able to deduce that. However, since this is for fun & learning, I wouldn’t get too caught up designing a precise end-product or design.
Doing this for commercial work?
We need to get way more specific about your deliverables (a.k.a. what precisely do they want this to help them do at the end of the day …and what do they assume that will look like?). Since you haven’t provided much of that information, I’m willing to wager that you are getting way too deep into this problem for your expertise and there’s likely a better way.

Disclaimer: I want way more people to learn how to code, but if you’re under a deadline already …you can’t afford to make a productive investment in building your knowledge for a project this wide in scope

However, there is hope! Again, I can only run with how little you’ve shared. You want a more specific answer? Try asking a more specific question.
I’m willing to wager that you’re working on more of a data science project that can just as easily be solved without “reinventing the wheel” yourself. If you’re just trying to help your clients make more data-informed decisions, then I wouldn’t invest a ton in computing resources to crawl “the entire internet” doing your own primary research. Why not leverage the data others have already collected on this problem?
There are many teams out there that have already answered these types of questions and have data widely available for you to leverage. You might be better off preparing a dataset (a.k.a. spreadsheet) with this data that you’ve manually acquired yourself. That way, you can answer the questions like “How many sites in the world are using Shopify? How many sites in the Top 1000 most visited sites are using Shopify?” and on and on.
The thing people who don’t code don’t understand, is that most technologies “stand on the shoulders of giants.” Every hand-coded solution is likely leveraging many libraries & frameworks that people have already done the heavy-lifting for. Here’s an extreme example: I didn’t have to build a crawler to get a “good enough” answer that one. It took one Google search:

How many sites in the world are using Shopify? 1,661,942
(Source: https://trends.builtwith.com/)
Hi!
Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply. That’s awesome. I love how much detail you put into it.
BuiltWith is a great example of what I’d like to do. It’s fairly old technology, so there should be existing libraries of code. I don’t need a polished solution like BuiltWith, but I would like to learn to crawl the web and export the results.
Since I’m 100% new to coding I don’t know what I need to learn. Obviously there are some basics like Python syntax. And the course on Beautiful Soup would probably be very helpful. But what other Python courses would be ‘required’ learning? Do I need to know about databases? I’m guessing the answer is yes, but I don’t know which course is the right one. I also don’t know how to access and implement 3rd party libraries at the moment.
Appreciate any recommendations on what to study!"
757,5/13/20 - New Design for Path & Course Syllabi,Corner Bar,5,249,"Hey Community!

We hope that this new design makes your journey easier to understand and follow.  We’re always working to improve the experience, how can the syllabus view be better?  Let us know in the comments!
[update 7/21/17] we have now started rolling these out for courses too.  Keep your feedback coming!more whitespace is always a good feature . looks amazing . iam looking forward to it.I love the white space and it does make the info easier to digest. I do miss the confetti, though! It’s the little things. Please bring back the confetti! Noted!  You’re not the only person to ask about this, and we’ll look into it.  Thanks for considering my request! It was so satisfying to go to your syllabus and see that you had earned some celebratory confetti  I’ve been loving the change. Particularly, the really convenient access to the cheatsheets now after a section is complete.
My feedback:

While a section isn’t fully completed it will show the number of lessons, projects and quizzes in that section as a subtitle. Once the section is complete though, that information will be lost and switched to the links to the cheatsheets. Might be just me but sometimes I go back and I like to know what’s in each section without having to click to expand it.
The old design included a summary at the top with the title of each of the 14 chapters of the Web Dev path. That’s gone. I would imagine it was nice for a lot of people to have a quick view of what was in store for the path?
With so much white space, it takes significant scrolling to make it to the bottom lessons

762,MATH for computer science,30-Day Challenge,3,301,"Hello fellow learners,
Are there any math resources you like have found/find helpful on your path with computing? I’m interested in any thoughts you may want to share about math and your computing journey.
I’m particularly interested in AI and data science tracks, as well as cryptography, so I have a lot of math ahead of me.
I have been going through a phase of recapitulating and improving my rusty math fundamentals. and just developing a new way of relating to and thinking about math. This has required a lot of courage; it is not so difficult as it is tedious to get back into these things I learned, without ever having really properly learned them sequentially when I was younger. It seems one of the major mental obstacles to coding and particular branches of computer science is just dealing with the accumulated detritus and effects of poor math curriculums and unhelpful relationship to math.
I’ve found online “smart” platforms where I can do problems and track my progress most helpful. I love them because they help me make the most of my learning time to make faster progress, moving quickly through material I already understand, and zeroing in and giving me practice on problem sets where I have most rooms for improvement.
I’ve used IXL for this, and also Aleks, but only for the review of the fundamentals so far, not yet for anything past algebra. I also know of a platform called ZyBooks but haven’t used it. Does anyone have any experience with these or thoughts on them or others at fundamentals/algebra level and moving beyond into statistics, precalculus, discrete math, linear algebra, calculus, and other relevant math? I’ll be doing a long sequence of self-learning over the coming year and any thoughts or resources you have to share would be most helpful in tuning my strategy design.
In addition to online AI/Machine Learning-based platforms, I’m interested in books you’ve found effective, forums, online courses, communities or other resources you might recommend. I thank you so much for any insights, resources, comments. All the best!I hear very good things about Khan Academy (though I haven’t used yet) and there are some yt channels like socratica that present some concepts well.
Be sure to check out Stanford, MIT, and other university’s free yt course videos (they’re quite abundant and some really help out for things like data structures and algorithms etc).
Scribd is pretty affordable and has a ton of textbooks on specific topics (linear algebra, calculus, geometry, statistics, as well as data structures, etc).
I personally recommend Robert Witte’s Statistics, it’s very well thought out and makes it fun (ha?) to study the subject.thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my post! i really appreciate it. in particular, i haven’t seen the text book you mention. is there something in particular you like about it? i did look in scribd for texts but found it somewhat cumbersome to search for texts without having specific titles. admittedly i didn’t spend much time doing it yet. upon your recommendation i’ll have to spend a bit more time digging around there.One strategy I take, is I check forums like reddit, discord, irc to see what the top recommended books on any topics are and I check scribd or buy them myself if I really want to get good at that topic.
As for the Witte, I’m including a screenshot to help.
Considering I’ve been reading a lot of textbooks these months, Witte has a combination of having really good/clear/concise/organized information while also striking a light tone. A great textbook really only needs to be clear and organized by my standards, but for it to find moments of levity really translates the joy in the craft (hence my recommendation).

And then there’s also the language’s (whichever language(s) you want to find out about) docs which are very useful for learning syntax/built-in methods.

where can I do that?Codecademy is a learning environment with lessons, i wouldn’t use codecademy for your own personal projects.
setup your projects locally on your machine. But without knowing what the project is and the languages involved, its difficult to say, if you could tell us something about it, we are very likable able to help you further.
if that is too big a step, there are sites like codepen.io 33, repl.it, jsbin and jsfiddle you could use. repl.it has a lot of languages, the others are html, css and JS.
don’t get hung up on such sites for too long, in the end you will have to setup your own local development environment.can you give me the exact URL for repl.it?
I want to write a program in python.click here 13, i did, but because its an ucommon domain, codecademy didn’t make it clickable.
i am sure there are similar tools like repl, repl has python.
but i would be better to install python from the python website:
https://www.python.org/ 3
and install a text-editor like atom or vscode to write your code.thanks but for now I’m sticking with simple coding and don’t really want to get my own code editor.
B.T.W:
can you run code from a simple text editor?
I’m just curious.


 temimam:

can you run code from a simple text editor?


there are text-editors and IDE’s which have this integrated, not all, and some require some setup or plugins.do you have a recommendation?
just in case I change my mind about the code editor cause this is becoming interesting.i would absolute recommend a code editor, which you can setup to suit you (more then website like repl.it can), which will make you more productive



 temimam:

do you have a recommendation?


difficult to stay objective here, i personally really like the IDE’s made by a company named Jetbrains. For python they have PyCharm, a community edition (free) and professional edition (which is paid).
Pycharm is really heavy (memory wise) and contains a lot of features, which might be overwhelming in the beginning. I really like it though.
visual studio code seems to have become really popular of late and might be easier to get started with.thanks! I’ll check them out.I personally use the programs from Anaconda including Spyder. Also Pycharm.You can use Google Colab for Python (it’s like Jupyter Notebook but on the cloud)
It’s easy to import a csv file from your local machine, or, mount your Drive to Colab (so others can view the files) too.
If you have a SQL server on your machine, you can also connect to that using SQLAlchemy (a python toolkit for SQL) & Psycopg2, [a db driver to connect to a db system] which SQLAlchemy is dependent upon."

Sometimes I will test it by cutting my code, getting the solution, and pasting my answer right next to it so I can compare character by character, so I know it’s right. Is there some technical thing I can be doing to cause this? It happens only every once in while… maybe once a lesson or so.I don’t believe this should happen.
Are you absolutely certain there was no variation between the correct answer and yours?
Which course is this in, and could you post a link to one of the lessons that has this problem?Sure as I can be, given comparing the solution code with mine, character by character. I have done that several times. On some occasions, I have caught a mistake, but others I have failed to. And when I paste the answer, it even takes up the exact same space as the others–do you know what I mean?
This has been an issue with my Codecademy learning for a couple of months, in a variety of courses that I’ve worked on. I used to file bug reports but it seemed to be so persistent that I gave up. I wonder if there’s something weird with my interface… just using standard Chrome so. Maybe it’s because I’m still on Windows 7, could that be it?

do you know what I mean?


If you are referring to indentation than yes I do.
It could be your older operating system, though I don’t think this would be the case.
You could check by logging in on a computer with a newer OS.



 migueldemaria0134906:

By this do you mean the latest updated version?

This seems like a bug report, would you like me to move this to bug-reporting? It should receive greater attention there.Yes, up to date, hardly any extensions.
If you want to move it, that’s fine. I don’t have any specific information as far as lessons, etc. I was more interested in finding if other people in the community were experiencing this issue, or if it was just me.If like you said you have reported this in the past, I will leave it here for now.
I don’t believe I have ever had this problem.
I’ll definitly be watching this topic now.The next time it happens, the following would be very helpful:

a link to the exercise
a screenshot of the learning environment, so I can see where you were at, what your code looked like, and the error the LE raised to you,
a correctly formatted copy of the code you ran to try and re-create the problem. (See here if you’re unsure how to format code here on Discuss.)

That should let me try and recreate the problem. "
770,Renew subscription and lost refund my account,"Careers, Journeys, and Stories",7,230,"Hello,
I messaged four times through “Get help” support section from your codecademy website and emailed as well about subscription to renew and also I had refund $39.99, which was in my account and cannot find it when I log in. And it won’t show after my previous subscription expired. I haven’t heard from anyone yet. I am very disappointed, and why would anyone ignore my message and email. In my previous year as a pro member never had a support from your staff. I will do myself to finish web development career path. Please, reply.  I’d like to renew and lost my job due Covid-19. I’d like to start coding and get  a job.
Thanks!Hello @mjaji
Unfortunately , we can’t settle billing on the forums.
However since you say you have submitted tickets already and have not heard anything back, I can ask someone to look into this.
I am not certain I understand your problem though.
Are you asking for a refund, or asking to renew your subscription?well, I am asking for both. I had refund then would have added that payment to help me to renew subscription.And just tell them to look into this issues. Yes, I had submitted tickets several times and the staff kept ignoring it. Also, emailed them. So disappointing.I sent a message to ‘those higher than me’ within the forums, asking them to look at this.



 mjaji:

the staff kept ignoring it.


As I understand it there has been quiet a bit more activity than normal due to the current virus situation as people are looking into new jobs. I doubt they would have ignored it, it is most likely just mixed with a large pile of other requests they have to work with too.If you are getting your subscription renewed, what are asking to be refunded?It was partial refunded, because I wasn’t happy to book a session with a coach.  So I cannot use that refund to renew it. Even, I cannot get these payment back to bank account. Have a look at attachment, then in what ways do I have to use that refund.
Capture692×316 11.3 KBI received a message from one of the admininstrators that this has been sent to the staff.

771,The Data Science Path is repetitive and not well put together,Suggestions; Feature and Course Requests,3,213,"Hi,
As said in the title, I find the Data Science Path to be a bit repetitive and not very well put together. What I mean is that it’s quite obvious that instead of being one very big course which contains the material of multiple little courses, it’s just a bunch of little courses put together. I understand that it would be virtually impossible to re-do every course so that it fits well, but still.
More precisely, some topics are seen multiple times, some are seen in an order which I find to be strange and as courses are made to be standalone, it’s always made as if it was the only course that you’ve taken.
For example:


A topic seen multiple times:
The use of a histogram and all of the theory about it is explained in part 11., in the course “Introduction to MatPlotLib”, but then it’s also all seen again in part 14., in the course “Histograms”. The latter is a better introduction into it and should be seen before I think and then just the practical aspect of how to plot it should be in the matplotlib course.


Topics that are in the wrong order:
In the matplotlib and seaborn introduction courses, the box and violin plots are seen, and both use statistical quantities such as the mean, the median, etc. These quantities are not at all explained (which is fine, I can search online if I want), but then, there’s complete courses on each of these quantities, but AFTER. I just think that it would be way more logical to explain these quantities first and then see them “in action” in a box or violin plot.


Courses meant to be standalone:
In a lot of courses I have seen half of the explanation being about Pandas, numpy, list comprehensions, etc. when one part of the code used one of these libraries or mechanics. I think that this could be easily fixed if these explanations were in a separate page or “slide” of the course and then ignored if the course on Pandas or numpy, etc. has been seen by the person.


These points are not that big of a deal, but they are little things that annoy me quite a lot, and, frankly, makes me want to stop using codecademy at that time to do something else instead.Hey there,
I’m 75% on cs path and 30% and I feel you on your critiques (I have many too).
I think any resource at this point is going to have its strengths and downsides. Diversifying can help overcome this (books, good youtube channels, irc, discord, other more specific sites for certain topics).
I will say that for all the shortcomings I can often come back to these forums and get some in-depth look at a variety of things (delivered in a civil way, which is not the same everywhere).
I’m sure they are trying to improve on ironing out these kinks, but between that and developing new courses for the ever-changing environment, it’s a balance that would probably require a more expensive subscription model (my opinion here). At a certain point, the cost-benefit is not going to favor codeacademy. There are other institutions that do deliver a fuller training, but the price is accordingly more expensive.
tl;dr: there’s no one stop shop at this price point.
I feel you though, curriculum structure is very dear to my heart (as I am a teacher) and seeing it like this does grate me. But I take what I can from it in spite of the structure. I wouldn’t recommend it for everyoneThank you very much for the feedback!  I assure you that we are keeping an eye on submissions here even if we don’t always reply and can’t always take action.  In this case however we are indeed reinvesting in the data science and web development paths as we speak and this feedback was useful for that.  
Let me lower your expectations though, (re)building content is a very time consuming endeavor so we can’t make all the improvements overnight, but stay tuned.Thank you for your work! Great projects take time to build and I truly think CA is trying to put out a great product."

I was wondering, is there a way to query from my databases in Athena directly from an excel file?
Thanks for the help!
Stay safe 
Best,
AlexHi there, welcome to the forums.
There appears to be an ODBC data driver 9 available for Athena, so I would imagine that theoretically you could install the ODBC and then configure your Athena instance as a data source.
Excel might then be able to leverage that data source to run the queries. Thanks a lot for your answer "

Tomorrow something pretty epic is happening: SpaceX is launching astronauts to space unless some last minute problem happens.  They’ll be sending NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS. It will take Crew Dragon about 19 hours to reach the ISS and although the capsule is design to dock autonomously, astronaut Hurley will take manual command to test flight systems. Read all about it HERE 2
image970×546 44 KB
I was curious about what it is like to work as a software engineer at SpaceX and found some cool answers on Quora: (link), and (link). From the links:
What’s a day like?
My days typically consist of: running tests on our high-fidelity hardware-in-the-loop testbeds (they’re really cool), learning about the new features that we’re implementing and thinking about ways to test them, development work on our test automation suite or on test cases themselves, and working directly with various engineers (from a surprisingly wide range of disciplines) to test the subsystems they’re responsible for. I also do a lot of direct vehicle support: performing the final software tests on the vehicle prior to launch, working in a clean room environment to configure the vehicle’s computers for flight, etc.
What languages [and] environments do you work in?
Examples include: Python, C++, Go, vim, bash, GNU screen (my favorite), LabView, and a lot of internally-grown technologies.
Finally, follow live coverage on YouTube 1 starting at 3pm ESTAmazing!! I have been waiting for this moment for awhile now!!
I hope safety for the crew, and a successful mission.Looks like SpaceX are going to beat Boeing to the flag 1…
Difficult to believe that the last shuttle mission was way back in 2011!We are watching live now
Boy am I excited!!  I got friends working both at SpaceX and Boeing in Cape Canaveral and they keep sending me photos and videos of things they see. I’m so jealous!Go for launch!!
50 minutes and counting!!

776,[n/a] “Save” Button won’t run program,Bug Reporting,14,276,"Screen Shot 2020-05-24 at 3.15.38 PM1390×794 135 KB
I’m working on the “Create a Table” project in SQL in the Data Science path. I can’t seem to run the program, every time I press “Save” it saves the program but never runs it. Am I missing something? I saw a couple people post about a bug similar to this, saying they just refresh every time they want to run it, but even that workaround doesn’t work for me. In the attached screenshot I tried writing bogus to break it just to see if it would throw an error, but it doesn’t work regardless of what I put in.
Thanks in advance Hello @babacher and welcome to the forums 
Can you provide link to this exercise so I can try to replicate the bug?
For now I will move this to the bug report category.Here’s 6 the link, thanks for helping out!SO far I am not able to recreate the bug.
Have you tried refreshing the page, and running the code again?I have tried refreshing, and it doesn’t seem to work. It does save the code, but doesn’t run it. I took a video of the issue, but since I’m a new user I’m unable to upload it. I tried it on Firefox as well as Chrome, and another computer, and get the same issue, I’m very confused. It could be something very basic that I’m not doing since I’m a newb, but if so I’m completely puzzled.I’m sorry I missed this.
Have you been running line 1 every time?
Breakk the program test

Try taking it away and see if the code runs correctly.
I know you used it as a test, but I think it may be messing the program up.
When I run the code with it I get the same display as you, but the code works well without it.Using bogus code should still throw an error though…Yeah, the code without line 1 still doesn’t run for me, I only threw it in there trying to force an error after it initially wouldn’t run with the clean code.
So just pressing save or command enter (for mac) should run the program in normal circumstances, no? If so, seems to be an error unique to my account, since I tried it on different browsers and machines.I have been using a Chrome book to experiment.
The code itself should run when you click save.
Perhaps it is unique to your account, though it could also be unique to me, I will ask a moderator to take a look.
However it is not throwing an error when I enter bad code, which I believe it should be doing.Hello @babacher. Have you tried putting single quotation marks(' ') around your dates:
'1930-05-30'

Even if this doesn’t work, this is good practise to enclose dates, strings, etc in single quotation marks.Hi there.
I don’t know whether it’s a feature of the LE not relaying any errors from SQLite, but I’ve spent a bit of time trying to re-create your issue.
If I write something in the SQL query to force SQLite into an error, the entire query is halted at the point of the error as one would expect.
In your case, even if I remove your opening line of “Breakk the program test”, your SQL query looks like:
CREATE TABLE friends (
  id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  birthday DATE,
);

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (1, ""Jane Doe"", 1990-05-30);

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (2, ""Jack"", 1995-02-15);

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (3, ""Grayson"", 1996-06-15);

SELECT * FROM friends;

The cause of your error is the trailing comma at the end of your table declaration.
If we look at the syntax diagram for the CREATE TABLE statement in SQLite, which I have reproduced from their documentation pages here, we can see the following:
image790×492 22.8 KB
I have highlighted the appropriate section with orange; this is the column_def section.
In the syntax diagram, you can see how the flow arrows only go to the comma after a column definition (like id INTEGER for instance) when we are gearing up to declare another column.
If I remove that trailing comma from your SQL, the LE runs your query fine:
image1279×421 30.1 KB
Can you please re-try the query without that trailing comma? It ought to run fine after that. 
Edit: To be sure, I spun up a REPL to check that I’m not talking nonsense. If I try and run the query with the trailing comma in the CREATE TABLE expression on line 1, I get this:

Thanks @thepitycoder! I don’t think we ever showed errors our SQL project because our SQL workspace don’t have a user-facing terminal and we don’t have tests for projects (we only have tests for lessons).
I think the learner is supposed to type SELECT * FROM friends; throughout the program to figure out what’s wrong with the code.
But this is great feedback though, I’m about to author more SQL content so this is good to know. And great answer to the learner, too!You were dead on! Removed the trailing comma, and it runs perfectly. Thanks for the thorough responses all, I really appreciate it. Sonny, I wrote SELECT * FROM friends; at the end of my program but I was used to seeing error messages from the little Python I’ve dabbled in, even if there were no tests. Thanks again everyone!


 sonnynomnom:

I don’t think we ever showed errors our SQL project because our SQL workspace don’t have a user-facing terminal and we don’t have tests for projects (we only have tests for lessons).


I’ve not done any of the SQL courses, other than any odd pieces where someone’s asked about it on the forums. My assumptions about the LE are based on how I’ve seen it work for the other languages I’ve done here (like Python, Go, etc…).
At least I now know that no result = SQLite error somewhere. Should be handy if this crops up again.

778,Why did CodeCademy change the older formatting of the printable cheat sheets,Learn From Home Club,4,417,"Hi guys,
I  was extremely happy with those cheat sheets. A year ago, I went back to all my courses and started saving the cheat sheets that associated with them once I found this little awesome feature. I’m now back to learning (one year later) and I found that you guys changed the printable version’s style of the cheat sheet.
The new format makes it really hard and a bit overwhelming to skim through as you go about coding a project as a beginner, mainly because you have code and explanation text mixed instead of code on the right and text on the left. I’ve attached the before and after example of your old versus new sheets.
I looked through the different topics in the forum and found one where @sonnynomnom was talking about cheatsheets 2.0. Perhaps this is when they changed the cheatsheets to the old format?
I am in love with the cheatsheets idea and the very concept that this was an initiative at Codecademy shows that they actually understand the process a learner goes through past finishing a chapter and moving forward.
However, is there any possibility that you revert to that older style? perhaps carry a survey and see if people found it far more helpful to use the older format? or maybe release them in a way/ format that makes it easier for me to restructure the sheets to the older format?
Or has anyone in the forum saved all the cheat sheets that were available in the old printable style at least for some of the Web Development courses?
Advantages of the older format:

A better-established text hierarchy which made it intuitive to index and visually search down a list to find what you need
An inverse color distinction between code syntax and explanation text
A side by side format of code versus explanation which made it even easier to search through the cheat sheet when you need to quickly refresh your memory about a specific topic among a list
This perhaps is very subjective but it truly reflected Codecademy’s brand in a way where people who’d see you looking at those sheets would easily associate beginner’s code learning with Codecademy.
