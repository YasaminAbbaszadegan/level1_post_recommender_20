I have a friend who is a developer and I really enjoyed having conversations with him. I myself wasn’t any sort of success in maths or other technical sciences in school and my occupation was an English-Russian translator. Coming back to that day, I asked myself what if there is a chance for a person like me in a software development world? What if I can work with interesting tasks along with nice guys like my friend? Can I even try?', 'I am from Russia and I didn’t like the opportunities I had in my small town to learn the needed skills. Then I found this very place online - codecademy. I liked the interface from the very start - clean, simple, beautiful. Then I tried learning HTML. I wasn’t that easy for me, but to say the truth it was exactly what I needed: not too easy and not too hard for a person to study it after a full working day. I tried to study at least 4 days in a week and I did more if I could. I finished HTML course in about a 1.5 or 2 months.', 'Studying HTML/CSS formed a good positive attitude - my success and a big aim of having a meaningful interesting job and a wealthy life didn’t let me go.

Maybe some people are able to remember things and build systems of knowledge in their head without practicing on projects and revisiting passed lessons in tests, but I’m definitely not one of them.', 'During JS course I faced some problems I couldn’t solve for several days and it frustrated me. Again, I had this forum to ask, I had CodeCademy advisors and StackOverflow but I didn’t want to go for their help right away as soon as I met some challenging task. At that time I had many doubts that I fit for this. But a big aim in my head and responsibility I feel for my wife, future kids and my parents gave me strength to go on in times of doubt. Don’t get me wrong - development consists of challenging tasks and this is exactly why you have a sense of meaning and deep satisfaction when you solve them. This is totally worth it. You’ll have enough positive feelings, believe me!', 'Over time I finished JS course and had a look at a chart of JS technologies by their popularity in professional environment, a number of job positions, and salary. I decided to pick React.js, maybe not for the right reasons but still this was a good decision. Later on I realized that you can do Android and iOS apps with it too. It was easier as it is based on JS, but it took a while to sink into my way of thinking of front-end development.', 'As I finished all the necessary courses I decided that I need to build a portfolio so I made myself a website and I also made one for a local restaurant I liked to visit. I made it for free to get a chance to get an experience and to make something useful that I’ll personally like.', 'After that I started to study Redux since it was required for the most React positions. At the same time I decided to put my resume and portfolio online, I mentioned that I can move to another city - and it changed very much for me since in my place there were very few positions for junior React developers. My advice - pay attention to its structure. It should be clear and straight to the point, but it should show you as a professional who can do the task (and it must be true).', 'I wanted to train to go through an interview. I tried to prepare myself that most employers will say no, because I was not that experienced, but it still was hard for me to hear their negative decisions. At the other hand It allowed me to see my weak points and rapidly heal the weak spots.', 'I must say that if you’re a junior you generally have a better chance in a larger company with a big number of developers since for them it doesn’t take that much to find you a mentor among a crowd of developers and allow him to spend his potential on you. Small startups have fewer mature developers and if they are hiring - they need seniors since they don’t have as much money and time to invest in juniors, they need to get the job done at an optimized cost.', 'Make sure to learn from negative interviews to make them positive for you personally. Your only goal here is to see your weak points, to fix them and to make it better next time. If you learn - inevitably in several iterations you’ll be successful. Feeling down is normal but don’t forget your big goal and go on. Your patience and wisdom will pay off over time.', 'After a couple of months of having interviews two companies became interested in me - one worked in education, the other was one of the biggest banks in the country and after interviews with them I had offers from both of them.', 'I made my decision and moved to Moscow - a way better place comparing to the place I lived before, and now I am a React developer in one of the largest banks. It all is thanks to the skills I developed when studying here and the ones I’ve got from failed interviews I had for two months.', 'My lesson - Be happy when everything goes right, and keep doing what you need to do at difficult times. The ones who didn’t overcome these difficulties gave opportunity for me to take their place. Be one of those who go on when they feel stressed.

Back in September 2020, we launched Codecademy Chapters as a way for Codecademy learners to meet each other and study together. With Chapters, you can join one and attend a meetup to connect with others who are learning the same subject as you.', 'I used to host weekly group focus sessions and invite any learner who would like to attend. After learners joined a few sessions and got to know one another, a few of them decided to team up outside of the group session to work on the Data Scientist Path together!', '@goku-kun @cvrloskenobi1 you guys met in my group focus sessions, and now you’re leading a Codecdaemy Chapter together! Can you say more about how you teamed up? And please add anything else that Adrian (and other learners) might find helpful when trying to find an accountability buddy.I think that working together is already encouraged (or, an overriding theme)----here, on Discord and on FB (I’m not on FB so I can’t say with 100% certainty) as well as in the CC chapters that Lil mentioned above. I think the onus more lies upon the individual to make it happen and reach out to other likeminded people. Chapters are a great starting point. Hey, @lilybird and @adriansomor. I met @cvrloskenobi1 through the focus sessions that Lil used to host, as she said above. And, during one of those sessions, Carlos mentioned that he was also working on the data scientist path, same as me. So, we got connected with the help of the codecademy discord server. And then, just talked it out. It’s always fun to learn with a peer. There are so many things that you can do as a learner if you have a buddy/buddies working on the same lessons as you. You can discuss, try to challenge each other based on the topic that you just learned and much more.', 'The best way to determine for yourself if you understood the topic as well as you think you did, is to try explaining the topic to others and you’ll find out exactly what you did and didn’t understand. I and, Carlos, have started working on the Data Scientist path and now, we even meet weekly using the focus sessions that we host. Apart from that, we have also shared our github account information with each other and created a data scientist repository where we make cheat sheets about the lessons, together, and also review it on our own time. So, that kinda adds as an extra layer of what we’re trying to do and gives more experience as to how one would collaborate with others in the real time.', 'I think sometimes you just have to take the plunge without thinking too much about it and then see for yourself if it worked out for you or not. If it did, improve upon it and if it didn’t, change the flow! Either way, you’re taking responsibility for yourself and that’s growth as far as I’m concerned.', 'I’ve also connected with @adriansomor through discord and we’ve talked about many things. Looking forward to working with you, @adriansomor. So cool, thanks for sharing @goku-kun!']\n",

I’m so curious, what would make you feel more confident in your skills, you think?Hey @kgnunn999!', 'I found that knowing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (especially the DOM side of JS) was very helpful and I would recommend advancing your experience in each of those languages (at least for a front end job). I’d definitely recommend trying to build your own websites. This will make you run into problems that you won’t know how to fix and so for sure advancing your knowledge.It was great up until I got to OOP and Inheritance.I am doing great I have just completed the 30days challenge. I did 30 minutes session every day. I feel I learnt a lot along the way but I am still not so comfortable with the language I’ll put more efforts on the next challenge.Woo-hoo I’m on day 30!! That went by so fast… and it’s incredible how much I feel like I’ve learned. Today, I’m working on the hurricane analysis project in python. Although I need to take some time to think about what I’m doing, the program seems to be doing what I tell it to do. (for the most part, at least… some corrections here and there)', '30 Days ago, I was learning how to assign integers and strings to variables, and today I’m writing a program that loops through a dictionary to create another dictionary. THIS IS SO COOL.', 'It would be foolish for me to not start another 30-Day Challenge. I’m on day 23 and it’s great I like the challenge of learning everyday and actually look forward to every session. Here’s what I’ve learned in my 46 years on earth. If you work hard at it and work in a way that works with your style of learning, over time you will learn. This is the sixth time in my career I’ve had to retrain myself. Having faith in yourself is key and having patience in the learning process. Keep at it and it will happen. Be well! I am about 50 days in.  I forgot to do my 30 day reflection.  It feels good to make progress in Python.  My interests with Py has extended now into machine learning, ai, and some financial applications.  As a profession math tutor I continue to remain interested in some of the cryptography and computational mathematics problems.  I am looking forward to integrate and synthesize more code with mathematics, extending some unfinished projects.', 'There is still a lot to learn – up to the modules section and exploring the vast libraries and modules one can import to enhance code.', 'One reflection that has come up several times is, “what is ethical use of technology?”  More specifically, is coding being used for legal, and humanitarian purposes, or is it being politically weaponized and or appropriated without our consent to weaponize an institution or state?  This reflection has led me to reflect deeper about the history and momentum of technology, ai development, government, politics, economic power, and international security.', 'What has come up is the question, \"What is it like to think about coding from a more human rights law perspective that seeks to enhance diversity in government, educational leadership and improving economic development, not just create greater tech gaps as we have witnessed with the big 5 tech companies?  More specifically, where do human rights discussions in light of technology come into play with not only the need for physical security, but now, also cyber security and stronger data protection?  Where does code come into play as a corrective force when technology is being used for illegal purposes, like surveillance without our knowledge or consent?  Can we use and develop code and communities of code to raise awareness for human rights principles?  And what can one do in light of diminished privacy concerns in this increasingly connected and technocratic age?  Can good judgment and leadership (not just technical know-how) exist in code more synthetically?  Can we keep certain bad actors without oversight more accountable with better code through more sophisticated diplomacy?Hi all!', 'I hope you are all enjoying your coding journey! I certainly am!

I can build tables and forms. layout documents with appropriate white space, to provide ease of reading.', 'CSS; provides limitless styling of webpages using selectors and properties. CSS allows me to add colour, font stylings, positioning and display properties. Flexbox allows for responsive web pages that react to resizing of the web browser window.', 'JavaScript is a programming language that provides webpages with logic. This script allows users to interact with webpages. Some new concepts introduced to me were asynchronous functions, promises, await, and requests.', 'I have also learnt to think about errors in a different way. I now have a methodical approach to debugging instead of the panic that used to set in when seeing the red text. I am more comfortable using the command line. Learnt how to use Git and make commits to GitHub, I look forward to using these skills more in the future.', 'I am currently learning JSX, which is an interesting blend of JavaScript and HTML.

      "['Dear Community and Codecademy,', 'My name is Will, and I am a middle school student currently enrolled at Postlewait Middle and Ceasar Rodney High School in Delaware. As a member of the Technology Student Association, I would like to learn how to code in depth. Although I have looked a other free options to learn, I originally started with Codecademy when it was still 100% free and became accustomed and somewhat attached to the way Codecademy teaches. However, although my family is not financially challenged, I don’t feel that I can pay $20.00 a month for Codecademy. I am not suggesting that learning to code with this amazing program is not worth it and should be free, although that would be nice, but I do think that there should be a discount. I was hoping that a Codecademy employee would read this and possibly be able to add a student discount to bring the price down, for students, to (in my mind) around $5.00 a month.', 'Thank you for you attention,', 'Will', 'An aspiring coder.Hello,', 'Codecademy doesn’t give out discounts, however all the lessons are FREE to access, only the following is pro:', '', 'Help from advisors', 'Quizzes', 'Projects', '', '', 'If you want to get in touch to a CC employer you can visit help section:', '', 'http://help.codecademy.com/ 855', '', '', 'For those who cannot afford it,', 'You can get help here on Codecademy forums,', 'You can challenge yourself with your own projects.To anyone at CodeCademy who wants your company to make more money - You’re shooting yourself in the foot.', 'http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=third-degree+price+discrimination 1.6k', 'You should seriously be applying third degree price discrimination to your pricing model so kids like Will here can get you more profit, and Will can consume a product/service which can’t cost you more on a marginal basis of 1 more paid user.A lot has changed in your pricing since last year.  There are less unpaid options today than in the past.  Again, it’s all good to charge but maybe an educational group price per school might be in order.Agree with @jhauer. There are many high school students who want to learn coding and it would be really nice to have any kind of discount for us. Even-though cost of your site is not that elevated comparing to others, high school students usually can’t work and any extra way of saving is always nice.With the increase of content being hidden behind a paywall, a student discount sounds like a fantastic idea. I know some University students that could use the help. Codecademy seems to become less and less an Academy and more and more a Commercial business not aiming at students at all. Luckely there are alternatives like repl.it or SoloLearn - Even a basic course on basics on Python 3 is on the PRO account now…I feel you, man. The Python 3 course being behind a paywall really triggers me. Most courses that CodeCademy has can be supplemented by an O’Reilly Media programming book bought off Amazon (depending on the book, somewhere between the price of 3-6 weeks of Pro) and a StackExchange (or something like it) account (free).', 'If a course will take more than 3-6 weeks to learn, and you want a physical reference, you are definitely better off buying a book.I love the way the do the courses, many times people just have an answer pop quiz but no hands on training, I think this is a good site to learn at but to expensive for people trying to learn something other than what  a bed feels like and can’t be able to go outside and enjoy life:( just maybe they can enjoy the programming life instead:) I am disabled and enjoy it here and hopefully one day I can get a job coding. This also helps with mental disorders, it scrambles your brain to forget and yes this does help alot with me, I have ptsd bad and I go straight to coding world and it sets my mind to a new way of life.', 'Love this site and it works!I definitely agree with you.

I was using Codecademy for Python 3 but now have to stop. I now have stopped using Codecademy altogether as there are free options to learn Python 3 elsewhere. A student discount would greatly increase profits and accessibility of Codecademy and would help more people use it for more than just coding basics.', 'I hope Codecademy will consider this option down the line.

Certainly a middle school student whop wants to learn to code should be encouraged, and it is plausible that such students may have no disposable funds .      College students are a different story. A college student can either use the resources of their college, learn to code from one of the many free tutorials on line, or come up with the $20 a month for code academy.Seems no one cares about this anymore, I should say that for most of the people living in the 3rd world (like me ) 15$/mo is a little bit expensive, I know that it takes a lot of time and effort to make this great platform work and i appreciate it a lot but having a student discount will be wonderful.Thank you, i appreciate it.Is there an update on this? I also would like to know student pricing.Hey Darby,', 'I think the same too. I’m now also a university student. Yes, there has many sites and products who have offered some discount or free pricing, excluding Codecademy and also some others.

Finished my free trial and really enjoyed it, especially the projects, but the current subscription prices/models don’t really fit my student budget.', '$39.99 each month is a little steep. The $19.99 per month for the annual is reasonable, but I can’t really afford the entire year up front. Not sure how things work in other countries, but in my country we receive our student loans in three instalments throughout the year. I could afford to pay $19.99 each month, or $60 a term, but $200+ from one of my loan instalments is a little too much.', 'Would love a wider variety of subscription plans.It doesn’t work.

It is specifically because of the disorder that ASD sufferers are great at problem solving (and yes, there is a high prevalence of nuerological disorders in the IT community, and stats are starting to emerge), and here is where the computer analogy applies again, because analytical thinking requires following logical structures; classifying items into specific, corroborable sections and identifying similarities between them, which means rules, just like the instructions of an algorithm. Problem solving is just breaking the problem down into its constituent parts, and then solving each small problem in order of complexity.

My cat is tired of hearing me talk things out, out loud. Hahaha.Being consistent is really hard for me. I could be learning about databases one day and the next one, decide that I’d like to learn to make games instead.

I am creating this thread to see if anyone has big struggles that they would like to share about and maybe some people will be able to provide useful advice to help. Thank you!My biggest struggle is to press on when feeling things are getting much harder than what I have learned so far.', 'Also I find it hard when I am coding and not see the results. I need something tangible that proofs me the things I do have an effect on the outcome.', 'For example I am currently working on the Ravenous project 107, I have written significant amounts of code now but I don’t see what it translates into. The app is not able to run yet.Definitely whitespace and spelling. I’m familiar with logic but trying to find my errors takes forever, and they’re always spelling/spacing mistakes.Syntax is pretty hard for me.  I get very frustrated when I get so close to solving a problem, but something very small that I overlooked is what causes errors.  The small details are what trip me up.  I also find that I “hit a wall” after a while, where progress slows down and it’s not as exciting as when you first started.  This is my third time trying to learn coding though, I used to slowly quit when I hit the wall.  Now that I’ve been through this a few times, I know not to do that this time.  It’s all about chipping away and practicing every day.  Not every day will be huge progress, but keeping consistent is what’s important.  I’ll look back at the end of 30 days and be proud.I have one single struggle that I have dealt with for YEARS: Consistency. I am an electrical engineer so the logical systems behind programming come somewhat naturally beyond syntax. Nonetheless I find it hard to stay consistent for long periods. I find that I allow life to get in the way.

If you don’t have an application and work backward to develop the math skills, you won’t appreciate the process of learning the math. Programming and computer science is no different.

He thinks my questions are too basic, but sometimes I don’t know how to find the answer.  My degrees are in physics and math, so I understand the logic, but sometimes I just simply am lost.

A Primer starts us off with well documented and teachable fundamentals. That’s what program language documentation is.

Thanks for providing the link. I hope it helps me to understand documentations much better and it woud be easy for me to read docs.Nothing helps understanding documentation better than reading it. Videos can never replace that experience.I find taking notes on the more conceptual elements of programming more helpful than trying to take notes on everything. I find it more useful for me to have a highly organized bookmarks folder, where I can easily find the documentation for whatever language or framework I’m trying to use, as well as helpful articles and tutorials. That way I don’t have to google the things I know I probably won’t remember, or spend time trying to find where I wrote it down–I know it’s in the folder.For me and my learning process I find that it helps to write/take notes. I have notebooks filled with them and color-coded tabs with the subject matter listed (Python: Dictionaries, functions,  SQL: JOINS, etc.). I refer back to them often too.

Voniel shares with us how after college he left finance to pursue something more meaningful to him – coding. When Voniel is not coding, he enjoys listening to sci-fi/fantasy audiobooks, taking morning walks, and learning something new in the ever-changing world of technology.', 'Meet Voniel! ', '', 'Tell us a little about yourself.', 'Hi everyone! My name is Voniel Brown, and I’m a software engineering apprentice at Codecademy. I was born in Jamaica but I moved to the US when I was 8 years old and now live in Brooklyn. I love listening to audiobooks specifically sci-fi/fantasy, my favorite series right now is the Stormlight Archive. Before becoming a software engineer, I graduated with a finance degree which I then realized it was not what I wanted to explore as a career. After attending a Bootcamp to learn how to become an engineer I started at Codecademy in September.', 'How did you end up working for Codecademy?', 'During college, I was a member of the National Association of Black Accountants, and its motto of “Lifting as we Climb” always resonated with me. I wanted to make sure that I had a career as I grow and develop, I can help others around to achieve the same success that I have. Codecademy is the perfect company to achieve my goal and live as close to the motto as possible.', 'Did you always want to be a Software Engineer?', 'I was always fascinated by how technology connected people together and made so many things that were thought to be impossible a possibility. When I was younger it was always a mystique to me. My real interest in becoming a software engineer peeked when I was in high school and one of my friends introduced me to c++. It was truly fascinating to see the programs that he wrote, and it was especially amazing to help him work on his robot projects. After that experience showed me the possibilities that software engineering offered. As well as the thrill of building something and seeing it work, I knew I wanted to become a software engineer.', 'What are the best aspects about working as a Software Engineer?', 'One of the best aspects of working as a software engineer is that no two days are ever usually the same. Each new day provides an opportunity to try something new, even if you stuck on the same problem. There are often many different ways to solve an issue or squash a bug. I find it exhilarating to explore the different ways to find the best solution. It is also very fulfilling to see your work come together and your code is deployed to production.', 'What are the worst aspects about working as a Software Engineer?', 'One of the worst aspects of software engineering is that it is very easy to feel imposter syndrome. It is a wide and expansive field with so many new things to learn that at times you might feel like you don’t know enough or there is something that you are missing. It is also very easy to lose track of time, especially when you have a bug that you are on the verge of solving.', 'If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?', 'The Epstein drive from the Expanse.

When I was younger I wanted to be an aerospace engineer to make the spaceships that would allow humans to colonize other planets.', 'Do you have any advice for the learners?', 'When there is something that you truly can’t understand, don’t be afraid to seek out help. There were many times during my bootcamp that I was completely stumped by a problem. I was afraid to ask questions because I wrongfully believed that it would make me look silly that I could not understand. I was constantly banging my head against the wall because I could not understand on my own. I finally realized that I did not need to perfectly understand everything. There were people that were willing to help me in my journey. The more questions that you ask the better your understanding will be.', 'If you could make one brand new course what would it be?', 'Building a project with Golang. While our course on Go was an amazing introduction to the language I wanted to get more hands-on experience using the language within our platform. I would love to see more hands-on projects with Go, especially with our new portfolio projects.', 'What does a typical day look like for you?', 'I tend to wake up early in the morning which I used to hate but now I learned to make the best of it. After waking up I like to read bits of the news while eating breakfast. Since I am currently working from home it is very easy to stay in my room all day. So after breakfast sometimes I like to go out for a walk to the park to get some fresh air and sunlight, clear my head and get ready for the rest of the day.', 'After a quick shower, it’s right around time for my team to post our daily standup to get a sense of each member’s progress on our tickets.

      "['I’m a senior in college currently working on the Data Science learning path. After college I’m looking to become a Data Analyst to start off my career, I was wondering if all the topics covered in this path will be useful to helping me reach my goal by finding a job in this career field. I understand data scientist are more advanced than a data analyst, and I don’t want to spend my time learning something that will not be useful in helping me in my career.Hi Kevin, I’m not a professional Data Scientist, but I’m also interested in completing the Data Science here on codecademy. I worked as a market research analyst (qualitative and quantitative) for a number of years and have recently started getting into the “data science” side. I think that Data Science by itself is kind of a buzz word, but as far as I can tell, pretty much everything that is covered from a technical learning standpoint (coding, working with data in python or R, interacting with databases, visualizing data, etc, machine learning, etc) – ALL of that is directly applicable and helpful to being an Analyst. Having read various industry forums about Data Science (such as on Reddit), there is a lot of difference between what DS means in one company vs. another, and on the high end of the ability/pay scale the people that work as Data Scientists can be responsible for setting up entire networks and data flows, requiring very sofisticated computing skills as well as a strong background in statistics. Most people in the field say that going deep into statistics is more valuable than any of the other trend words associated with Data Science. However, to go back to your question, having looked over the course list here in the DS area, I think that all of it would benefit you (and me) moving forward. Somethings might be beyond what you need to start out as an analyst (i.e. Node.js, front-end programming) but those are solid areas to learn about when you get there. Hope that helps. One other thing, keep in mind that even when you’re working as an Analyst, you’re job is solving business problems and human problems. No one gets hired just to analyze something, they get hired to solve problems and improve the company’s situation. Everything you can learn here will give you a better toolset to solve problems, regardless of the job title or buzzwords.']\n",

For instance, on FED it’s 26 steps, and on Full-Stacj something around 40+.

All the templates are pre-built, you just need to pick one your customer likes.', 'Drawback #1: The templates are pre-built so you have limited access to color schemes. They are also limited, so as a freelancer you need to do some research to see who else is using that template. Are they a competitor of your customer? Do they sell something offensive to your customer? Can they be mistaken for your customer thus causing negative publicity?', 'Pro #2: Lots of plugins available. As I mentioned earlier, they provide lots of functionality.', 'Drawback #2: The plugins are continually getting updates, if you don’t keep everything up to date some of the functionality might break. As an example, I had a plugin that connected my Instagram account to the site, that plugin kept breaking and I had to reset the token to be able to see the posts on the main page.', 'Pro #3: Write your own plugin, potentially make some money out of it (this requires coding though…).', 'Drawback #3: The company or individual who made the plugin decided to stop supporting it, or delete it altogether. Now you have to find another one.', 'Drawback #4: You don’t have control over the code, so while you can install a lot of plugins for different things that you might need, you can’t customize it. If the bed and breakfast becomes so popular that it was purchased by the Hilton and now your WordPress website needs to connect to the Hilton’s website, then you need a custom API. I don’t know if that’s possible with WordPress, again my experience is limited.', 'That is why it’s more relevant for freelancers, you need to have a very good knowledge of what it can and it can’t do to determine how useful it can be for a specific client.', 'On the other hand, if you are a freelancer and your customer has an idea for the next ebay, or the next Amazon, be sure that you won’t be able to build that with WordPress. You need to code that, from scratch. There are plenty of frameworks and libraries that can help you, but you still need to build everything yourself.', 'Regarding freelancing, I gave a couple of presentations. The recording for the first one is here 17, waiting for @alissavigil to post the second one.', 'Regarding the backend, to my knowledge (I can be wrong) it’s very limited. If you need to build an API, I don’t think you can do it with WordPress. If you need to integrate with an API, not sure if it’s possible.Ok thank you so much for the in depth response. It’s very handy to have advice come from professionals, nothing can replace it.', 'I will most definitely look into your presentation tomorrow as I am done working for today. That sounds like a great resource', 'Ya my main goal for now is to become a freelancer. So maybe this will be covered in your presentation, but if not, I was wondering do you even need to know to code for freelancing, because as it sounds, wordpress is more common for small businesses and freelance situations. Unless you are freelancing for a big company maybe.', 'Second I was even thinking working remotely is better then working as a freelancer because you get benefits and can work remotely. In the future a goal of mine might be working remotely for an American company while living in Europe but I don’t know if that’s possible.', 'Also ever since starting down this path there’s always been that topic of college vs no college. I am 20 with one year of college done. I am majoring in computer science. Is their a usefulness of a college degree in the web dev field? Let’s say I want to pivot into software dev at some point, maybe then it’s more useful? I have lots of smaller questions like this but don’t want to ask everything at once.', 'So maybe when you have time you can answer some of these questions, that would be greatly helpful and I would be very grateful.', 'Thanks,', 'AndrejDo you have to know how to code? No, but that limits the type of clients you can take on. If someone wants a mobile app to go with their site, WordPress won’t let you do that. Also, big companies don’t hire freelancers, your clients will be limited to individuals or small companies. That means that the income you may receive is smaller because they will have smaller budgets. Can you make a living out of that? As I said in the presentation, if you want to be a freelancer coding is important but it’s the least of your problems.', 'Not a lot of American companies allow you to work outside the US, for security reasons. Even if you are American.', 'College is useful, but usually not for the reason people think of. I currently don’t use any of the things I learned in college, but it helped me develop an inquisitive an analytical mind. It shapes you for the future, and you might learn a thing or two. Also, some companies have a degree as a requirement for jobs, if you don’t have one then they won’t look at your resume.', 'I don’t mean to be rude, but if you don’t understand how a Computer Science major can be useful for your future given your interests, goals, and ambitions then you need to talk to the school counselor. You don’t want to spend time and money on something you don’t know how you’re going to benefit from.', 'If you want to be a freelancer, I suggest a double major in business and computer science. Then, you need to learn how to code. As a freelancer, you’re running a business where you’re your own boss. You need to balance assets and liabilities, develop business plans and marketing strategies, network with people and if you’re successful, hire people to work for you. It is not as easy as people think.', 'Is the double major required? No. Does it make your life easier? Absolutely. It minimizes mistakes while maximizing your budget and your strengths. It sets you up for success.Ok thank you so much for the response!', 'So far I have built a list of things I need to learn. It goes like this:', '-Digital Marketing', '-Codeacademy/FCC courses', '-Look for projects on freelance sites (I am beginner-intermideate level in terms of web dev coding languages… I learned html, css, javascript, and am learning python)', '-Work on my own projects', '-College', '-Build my website for a beat store I am making / for my personal portfolio website… would wordpress be able to make a beat website where I need people to be able to download beats and listen to them?', '-Wordpress', '-Learn installing software properly', '-Learn command line in depth (already know basics)', '-Learn about software depencies', '-Version control', '-Docker', '-web design', 'My main goal is to become a freelance web developer but looking at the job postings on upwork has left me very confused as to what to actually learn. I have been thinking that I should just follow codeacademy and freecodecamp curriculum, but again, after looking at the job postings, I see lots of skills I have never heard of.', 'Also the issue of wordpress vs handcoding is really confusing me, as I dont see the point of being a web developer if people can make their own websites these days really easily. My uncle runs a business and his website was made by him with wordpress.', 'How do I learn to build a website from scratch is their any good websites or videos on this? I would not know where to start coding or how to start.', 'Is my list of things to learn smart for my goal of becoming a freelance developer?', 'Again the upwork postings have left me really confused as to what to learn. Most of the skills are not stuff I find on FCC or Codeacademy but Ill have to look deeper. Also the skills seem to change drastically from job to job, so how do you specialize in one field while freelancing.', 'Is it smart to get a broad base of knowledge or should you focus yourself on one skill? I feel the latter is better, but it is proving hard to do.', 'I have more questions but cant think of them at this time.', 'If you have time to answer this I would be very grateful.', 'Thanks,', 'AndrejWordPress was made for people like your uncle, he’s not a developer and was able to make a simple website he needed. Keyword simple. The templates that WordPress offers have the functionality he needs. If you want to make something like this 28, you can’t do that with WordPress, you need to write it from scratch. The APIs for overdrive are complex, and the searcing mechanism rivals that of Google. Searching their catalog efficiently is very complicated (hundreds of thousands of records by several keywords), WordPress will not be able to do such a thing. Overdrive has their own developers, I used to test that site, the library sites, the mobile apps, and the marketplace where libraries manage their collections. This is not something a freelancer would normally do, but it is something they should be able to do. I don’t have details on your project, so it’s hard to say if it can be done with WordPress.', 'Codecademy has a career path for web development, I haven’t explored it but it sounds like they teach you what you’re looking for. If you haven’t watched the freelancing recording, this is something you need to know: different projects have different requirements. Just because you know Javascript doesn’t mean that everything can or should be done with Javascript. As a freelancer, you have to learn many different languages and technologies. Want another resource? Go to the angular website and follow the tutorial for the tour of heroes app, that is an example of building something from scratch.', 'You said you know HTML and Javascript, you need to build on those skills. I said build, not master. Mastering a language is not a realistic goal. Once you have enough experience with Javascript, learn something else. The job postings will give you a guide on what is popular and what skills people are looking for. Don’t know what it is? Figure it out, Google is your friend. As I’ve said before, you need to be resourceful. Most of the problems I resolve on a daily basis come from Google searches, someone has run into the problem before. I’ve only had 1 instance where I could not find an answer and it took me a week to figure it out on my own, I did it by analyzing the problem and looking for solutions for something similar.', 'Don’t know what to learn first? Read this post 24.', 'Your ultimate goal is to have a broad base of knowledge, you just have to learn 1 thing at a time. I always get the impression that people are in a hurry, I need to know this so I can get a job. It takes time, I’ve been doing this for almost 12 years and I constantly feel that I don’t know enough. Can you take on little projects as you learn? Of course, but it will be a few years before you can be able to make a living from being a freelancer.', 'If you specialize in something it should be a subject like finance or digital media or transportation, you should not specialize in a language or technology because it narrows your opportunities.thanks a ton…sir. for sharing a good information.Thanks so much, my dude.

Then ideally open up project next to the working web-site example (or the spec-sheet) and see how they compare. I worked from the top and did one section at a time. Use dev-tools a lot (right click and inspect) to see what is going on. If you get stuck then one option is to also inspect the working website and look at the styles there.

I thought it would be useful to share my story and help answer any questions in the hopes of helping others achieve their goals as well!', 'Earlier in 2018, I found myself at a bit of a stand still with my career. I was working as a Union Representative, so I was negotiating contracts, handling grievances, etc. I felt a bit stuck in my current role and saw no real way forward, so I sat down and tried to hone in on my real passion. I started researching possible career moves without going back to school and realized that a lot of people seemed to be learning to code and do web development and were getting hired without any Computer Science degree, but just having the skills to do it. I had always been interested in programming and had dabbled in it here and there, but had convinced myself in college that I was no good at math, so I could never possibly learn how to be a real programmer. But, having seen so many success stories of others who had done the same thing I was trying to do, I figured I had nothing to lose. So, in April, I signed up for the Codecademy Build Websites From Scratch Pro Intensive and lo and behold–I loved it!', 'I am married and had a 1-year old son at the time, along with my full time job, so I found myself mostly up late at night coding and learning everything I could. My wife is is nursing school, so after putting our son to bed, we were both locked in to our laptops, pursuing our goals. I learned HTML, CSS, and dabbled a bit with JavaScript, enough to the point that I could make my own portfolio site! I added in a simple web app, a beer recommendation website that interfaced with the Untappd API and gave users recommendations based on their previous checkins. Nothing crazy, but it showcased my ability to navigate basic JavaScript. From there, I also added in my Codecademy capstone project, and a simple site to showcase my homebrewed beers.', 'Once I got the portfolio up and running, I redid my resume, listed my past experience as well as my “Freelance Web Developer” work (which I never got paid for, mind you, but listed out everything I had done related to Web Development). I put Codecademy down under my education, as well as some freeCodeCamp certificates I had done while using Codecademy. I started attending a weekly Code & Coffee meetup (since evening meetups were out of the question with my son around), and started networking and became active in the #100DaysOfCode on Twitter. I kept my education going by doing all the courses I possibly could on Codecademy, and also supplementing a bit with freeCodeCamp and Udemy courses.', 'I had read plenty of resources about how to search for jobs, and when to know you’re “ready” and the consensus seemed to be that you’ll never really know when you’re “ready”. All you can do is start applying and potential employers will let you know whether you’re ready or not. So, I started applying! I probably applied to close to 100 jobs and had a couple phone screens, and did one coding challenge that I really didn’t do so well on, but it showed me areas I needed to improve.', 'Then, I got a call from a company 5 minutes from house saying they wanted to interview me. Mind you, this is not a tech company–it’s a company that sells printer ink and various other coatings, adhesives, etc. I did the phone screen, made it to the next round, and was really able to show off all the soft skills I had learned in my previous job, as well as hold my own talking about various technical projects I had worked on, how I thought through design elements, and what my workflow was like. They really liked my ability to communicate (being a union negotiator/organizer certainly helped with this!) and they decided to bring me on in a sort of hybrid role to do some marketing automation, content creation, as well as help out with the web development for their WordPress site.', 'I started this job about a month ago and holy cow–it’s amazing. I never would have dreamed that I’d be able to make a career change in just over 6 months, but it happened!

HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript will pay dividends and from there you can pick up almost any other programming language somewhat quickly. The concepts are what matters–syntax is always a Google search away and you can figure it out, but the concepts are what you need to learn to make that happen. Start building projects–any project and learn what you can out of them. Redo your resume, put up a portfolio, and start getting yourself out there. Network, go to meetups, get active in the community, and there’s a wealth of information and people willing to help you out on your journey. And then, start applying! A lot of employers these days are willing to take a chance on someone without a CS degree as long as they show they’re able to learn and take feedback/direction. The worst thing you can get out of applying is a rejection–and then you’re no worse off than you were if you hadn’t applied at all.

      "['I’ve always liked to kick back by listening to listening to the latest pop hits (Comment down below who your favourite singer is!), or listening to classical music whenever I’m studying, which is why I was inspired by this post. With back to school starting (for most of us on this forum, I bet), there’s no doubt that to get through our everyday struggles or to just keep living, music will be our aid for whenever we’re stressed. But how do they tie into computer science? The science behind music and their impact on our lives is a phenomenon constantly being reevaluated by researchers, from the role of synthesis to movement of someone’s body being translated into sound energy, it’s insane. I really like how computer science has been evolving like this, but I just think it somewhat takes away from appreciating old classics. Because can I be real, no one listens to Beethoven anymore, like the guy’s last album came out like a millennium ago! Making music has always been a way to socialize and bring a community together, and it’s really strengthening now even more, which is great! Like no complaints, I’m glad the queens be dominating the industry, and helping expand their network, because that usually means more music for us. But this in some ways, can also cause problems, believe it or not. Feedback from audiences, live shows, and other events that help mold singers to become human in the public’s eyes can be edited by software, which creates a false impression for a lot of viewers that they’re idols are such authority figures. Don’t get me wrong, looking up to a public figure is great, but if they abuse this, then that just negatively impacts the follower. It deceives some people in a way, so can it be argued that it has a negative or positive impact? That’s just my take on this new technology, tell me what you think! I just wanted to share this with everyone to let them be informed, and I guess it it sort of my story on what I think about music and technology. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to listen to some pop.I like to think of it like knowing assembly language or C.

I’m Zoe Bachman and I currently work as a Curriculum Product Manager here at Codecademy. I’ve been with Codecademy for over three years now, starting off as a Curriculum Developer writing content. I’ve touched a lot of different content over the years, like Learn HTML, Data Visualization with Python, Learn C#, and Learn How to Code (I like to call the one my brain baby). I currently live in Brooklyn, NY and spend my free time hanging out with friends at Prospect Park, reading longform articles, doing puzzles, and cuddling my cat, Nono. In my prior life, I was an art teacher and I’m currently part of two art collectives: tendernet and The Illuminator.', 'How did you end up working for Codecademy?', 'I was finishing up my Masters Degree at NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program when I got an email from a Codecademy recruiter asking if I wanted to apply for the Curriculum Developer position.

The interview process moved really quickly and in a couple weeks I joined the team!', 'Did you always want to be a Curriculum Product Manager?', 'Given that I made up the role myself, not really, haha. I’ve had a lot of different career goals in my life (including, at one point, being the female version of Indiana Jones). What I will say is that as soon as I started working at Codecademy, I became interested in the product side of things. Having gone to a graduate program that focused on invention, early on I wanted to start pushing the boundaries of what our Curriculum content and experience could be.', 'I started by experimenting in a couple of courses that I built, then moved on to making a highly experimental course (Learn How to Code), which we treated like a product, rather than just content. We did a lot of research to develop it and a series of user interviews to iterate on what we made. I learned a lot from that experience and kept looking for opportunities to bring a pedagogical and creative perspective to how we teach. It took a couple years, but I feel like I’ve crafted my (at least for now) dream role.', 'What are the best aspects about working as a Curriculum Product Manager?', 'Making up new things! I love combining what I hear from learners with my research into educational theory to come up with curriculum products, all the while keeping an eye towards the future of EdTech. I have a very interdisciplinary background and I get to pull on my creative thinking, research, design, education, and programming experiences as part of my work. It’s been really exciting to see ideas that I was working through in my notebooks appear as new courses or content items on the site. Another thing I love is that my role is a cross-team role, which means I get to collaborate with folks across the company, including other Curriculum team members, Product, Design, and Engineering. It’s a constant learning experience.', 'What are the worst aspects about working as a Curriculum Product Manager?', 'Not having enough time and resources  There are so many things we want to build, but it takes a lot of people and a lot of effort to turn those ideas into reality. It’s also risky! We can do lots of experiments and user interviews and feel relatively confident that we’re making the right things, but we really won’t know how it will perform until we put it in front of learners. I also like iterating on things, which we don’t often have the chance to do because we need to move to new projects and focus less on maintenance and improvements. But we’re moving to a more iterative approach, we’re hiring more folks, so hopefully it will be smoother sailing in the future.', 'If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?', 'Teleportation is always rad, but I think I’m specifically attached to the TARDIS.

It took me so long to get into coding because I kept getting frustrated with errors and went to classmates who knew more than me to help me out, rather than stick with the issue and try to make something - anything! - that worked that I made entirely on my own. I really had to re-learn how to learn when it came to programming and break down my assumptions of what being “good” at something meant, or even if being “good” was important! Getting rid of those types of hangups allowed me to be more exploratory as I built things and a lot kinder to myself as I learned something new.', 'If you could make one brand new course what would it be?', 'Just one? So tough! I come from a creative technology background and really want to expand our offerings in that area. I’ve got a p5.js course kicking in the background that we’re finally making (three years after I proposed it!). I’ve also always wanted to make a Unity course, since that interface is notoriously difficult to learn (plus it pairs well with the Learn C# course I wrote in 2019). Three.js is another fun technology that has very few learning resources. I also have a dream of an online, interactive way of learning Arduino and electronics. I have lots of friends who teach creative technology and I think these courses would be useful to them as they approach teaching online for the first time.', 'What does a typical day look like for you?', 'Now that I work from home everyday, a typical day for me is getting woken up by my cat at 9am and rolling into the living room to do some morning yoga (she loves yoga because I’m stuck on the mat and have to give her pets).', 'Most of my days are packed with meetings - I lead our senior curriculum developers in a weekly meeting where we discuss our current content production, then I’ll meet with the developers working on our new career paths.

You can buy a Python 3 book for a month’s worth of Pro and your money would be spent more effectively.', 'The Minimax course didn’t explicitly say it was a Pro course in the email (which I won’t criticize), but shows another fault of Pro: there’s no taste of the more advanced stuff unless you get your free seven-day trial.', 'Another problem I have with the Pro courses is that they aren’t cost-effective. Look up “learning pandas python” and you will find many FREE tutorials for learning the pandas library with Python. You save 100% of the money you would have spent buying Pro for a month, no matter which plan you buy.', 'So what’s the point of this? I don’t care for the “be a Pro if you want to learn more” mentality. I don’t know anything about marketing; maybe it’s just fine.

I’m taking the Web Developer path right now and I looked it over thoroughly before subscribing to Pro. I was impressed by how the path was a fully structured curriculum aimed at giving you a specific skillset and the breadth of content and length was similar to what you would get from a community college or trade school certificate program (for significantly cheaper). For example, in my area, a 12 week web developer certificate course at a technical school would require me to attend 3-hr night classes twice a week and would cost me ~$2000 or more - and I don’t even know if they would get into full stack web development in that time (versus just focusing on HTML/CSS).', 'Additionally, versus a book or YouTube videos, you can’t beat the guided learning structure that Codecademy does really well. My favorite part is how it automatically scans and checks your work as your progress. Yes, you can buy a book and follow that or go through free tutorials on YouTube but I have always found they lacked structure and for me there was always the uncertainty of “is this going to teach me all I need to know?”. I’ve bought books on C+ in the past and have struggled with following along. I’m not saying you can’t find the right resources for free online, but $20/month removes all the guesswork, all the searching and gives you a structured curriculum from trusted instructors.', 'Again, I’m not trying to give you a hard sell on it and this is just my genuine opinion as a Pro subscriber. Perhaps try some of the free courses first and see if you like it enough. If you look through the Paths, you can also get a sneak peak of what you would have access to with a Pro membership - you can even see all the sections, courses and projects you would get.', 'I hope this helps. All the best to you!My goal is to be a full blown software engineer, or a web dveloper at the least.

I guess Pro isn’t for everyone, so I didn’t want to ruin their experience, but I felt there were some “flaws” I felt compelled to address. Quotation marks because not everyone feels that way.Personally, I’m kind of torn between pro/ not pro. I started “pro” less than a week ago mainly for the extra projects you can do. I like the structure it provides through the paths section as well as the content it gives you. I noticed that it follows closely in-line with the courses I was taking through Udacity, but these subjects seem to be filling in the huge blanks I was getting through Udacity. I also like the fact that the courses I’ve been seeing in the website developer path is mostly stuff I would do on a daily basis and not useless information I’m never going to use again.I think most of the folks always miss the point that a Pro subscription gives you access to real time advisor help available 16 hours a day.

If the sky really is the limit, even if it is a large one, we’l never be able to go past it once we’ve reached it! But that’s not what I’m here for; I’m here because I have another story to tell.

EMPOWERMENT. Fight for what you like. Forums are a great way to share your beliefs and find people who like what you do as well. Having something in common isn’t the only way to make friends though.

You brush your teeth, take a shower, and scan the newspaper before taking your briefcase filled with important papers to your job of the day. You walk into the office, say hello to a few coworkers, and they say hi back, before going to sit at your cubicle. You stare at this empty void and begin to type. You grab a cup of coffee, and that is merely the highlight of your day. (This is my food mention for the day, folks!)

Maybe not, but this is the type of life a lot may find themselves in, and consider it a sacrifice for a well-paying job. But at what cost? I think coding is a great way that a lot of people are able to learn about their passions, and even redefine what they know about the world. Some tips I would recommend while coding would be finding a project that you really enjoy doing, or even introducing a project at the workplace. This would make your skills stand out even more, and you would be able to not stick to a single routine. Introduce collaboration, overall mental health and well-being even, as a part of whatever you decided to plan. Even if your job has nothing at all that relates to coding, or requires no academic prior knowledge, you can inform those in the community that you work in about your experiences with coding. Share your experiences and develop an understanding that will hep promote your personal brand and interests! How have you shared coding with those in the community that you work in? And if you’re lacking any motivation, I would check out Forbes’s article on Chuck Feeny and his mindset on giving and journey into philanthropy. I know this has almost nothing to do with philanthropy, but I personally thought it was interesting to see how he was able to develop this passion that meant giving up a creating lifestyle, and how he helped inspired others. There are a lot of different ways to define and interest; You can call it a natural talent, something that you just do to pass the time, but either way the commitment and level of respect anyone dedicates to any activity is something that should be admired and more openly shared, together. My story with this particular mission would be helping develop technology endeavors, and funding for such research opportunities as a volunteer. I helped recruit a lot of people to supp rt a cause, and was able to give others the insight they needed to know how to handle the diseases they had and what resources were available to them.']\n",

I chose the Code Foundations Path to base my example off of , because it’s one of the most introductory paths, which is what I’m aiming for this to be.  A long with the introduction, as short lesson or 2 can be included that has the user can use to understand what coding is, with another on different people in history who have made breakthroughs in the industry and shaped what we know about coding and it’s application today. To further reinforce these concepts, the content will be spaced out in chapters/ sections that will improve collaboration, and more. I will space out more of the content, but what I’d really like to see is people being able to work together more, and be taught not only theoretically, but in a more hands on nature, that will improve the overall ability to find an identity and cultivate a space dedicated for such a mission, will help empower each other.

I thought that was really interesting, since it tied in with technology, but never did I think dermatology could be impacted by evolving tech. The history of tech is what redefines most of what we do, first used in the form of type writes, and other conventional tasks. So bringing technology to benefit women and their choice to wear makeup I thought was a really great idea, because we’ve always supported male domination, of sorts. So making women more aware of the products they use and overall health, I think is a great way we’ve stepped up to responding to a lack of women in STEM and more women empowerment as well. That’s just my take; Anyone else feel like they’re misjudged in anyway be it their race,decisions, or gender? You, my dear friend, are not alone. While we have made an effort to acknowledge these inequalities there’s not much we do about them. Coding should be where it starts.Health and beauty tech have been around since the advent of the 386 CPU. There was finally enough horsepower to do the computing necessary for color recognition, color temperature, shadows and gray scale, and so on. One such product we promoted in the mid 80s was the New Image Salon System.', 'We could sit you down in front of a camera, feed the image into the program and produce images of your face with any number of hair styles and colors. Once the customer was set on the one they liked, we printed the picture and they took it to their favorite stylist.The nice thing about today’s technology is it is much cheaper owing to scale. Back then, the system I mentioned above would run about 25,000 USD. That included computer, monitors, camera, printer, software license and a five year subscription to monthly issued  new style releases.That’s really informative. I never thought such technologies would have existed or that they would play a part in health and wellness, because it’s a topic that’s more recently been up to date. Making it cheaper, I think, was progressive, as it would be easier to obtain and more people can be aware of the technology']\n",

It’s not that I’m a bad coder or lack motivation, after all the word bad in front of any job title, is simply a highlight of your self-esteem. Ok, so this may seem like mind-dumping, or reeking, call it what you will. However, are there really enough resources out here that will help coders… not code but express themselves more in a better way? The lessons on Codecademy, I find are pretty structured, and by that I mean you really do not have much freedom as a beginner. A pro? Well, this person would have the ability to design entire apps, websites, the whole shebang. Is it… their determination? Enthusiasm? I want to know. How does a person who thinks like a computer, tells it what to do, foster enough creativity? As in, the ability to freely highlight an emotion, a risk, a swipe of a angry painter? Emotions, my dear coders, are not something computers have. At what point do both intersect at crossroads? As an app developer or even a beginner coder, you have basic knowledge that you appeal to before going anywhere. In other words, you have the  four wheels  you need to drive that car. But decorating the car… the app developer may have some experience with graphic design, aka the placement of various designs that are aesthetically appealing, but where are the ergonomics? What will give the beginner the same ability to develop an app like a pro? Let me tell you: Say it with me, creativity. To tell you the truth, I do not know much about coding I can make lists, tell the difference between a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from a cheese sandwich, but I, my dear fellow coders, do not know much about coding. But what makes me a good app developer? Creativity.

      "['So, when I’m on a flow, writing, it’s awesome, let me tell you. By the way @aorchowski, really applaud the way you helped garner yourself a lot of readers, and are making an effort to merge healthcare into the world of coding + quick shout out to @yizuhi, for commenting on my post, really gave me a lot of insight! You both have inspired me, so I want to do something similar with this post. Also, if you haven’t checked out my last post, it’s in Careers, Journey’s and Stories, it’s called “Coding Isn’t Hard, it’s like rocket science!” I also have another post published under “Suggestions, Feature, and Course Requests” called “There’s a New Idea For Teens? No way!” So, if you want to check those out, there they are! However, my topic today is going to be about those who feel underrepresented in the community, and how we can apply the outside-world in coding. For example, how are women perceived in the coding industry? Let me answer that first, because as I was typing the question, a quick thought occurred to me. Don’t women have the same capability of typing in the same numbers and letters? Like they both have fingers, right? Male dominance has always been a pillar of some sorts in our society, in that a lot of phenomenons that were introduced early in civilization were handled by men, when women held no role in science at all. Well, maybe one or 2 scientists helped out with breaking this rule (See: Marie Curie), there were not enough trailblazers to stand in the way of demolishing this belief in the 21st century. I think we should change that. Not many people realize what a lack of women in the coding industry means. It means that this idea  of a society has not changed for centuries, so, what will? No seriously, if woman after woman couldn’t get the job done for years… then what can we do?', 'This is where I’m going to propose a strategy: Read, with a capital R. One of the first books I ever encountered that gave me the insight into what actually went on behind the fields of science and math was Primates, which is a book on 3 women, Jane Goodall, Birute Galdikas, and Dian Fossey. When reading this book, I found that a lot of anthropology had been linked to how we define our advancements in technology. Early in the years, man or civilization had always been defined by the use of tools, which is what led to the discovery that we share over 90% of our DNA with chimps. But we’re going to take that phrase away, and input it with a new hypothesis I came up with: Man is the ability to create tool (Yes, I know I’ve been going on about how there’s a lack of women in the industry and all, but I’m trying to get into the whole spirit of things, so don’t @ me about that!  ). However, back to the main idea, we have to be able to create and spread awareness of this issue. Create awareness and cultivate enough information to prove employers wrong. I know a lot of us may not have experience with, I don’t know, setting up a benefit (although that would be great), or something else professionally done, but why can’t we assume leadership in the role of women in tech by being empowered together? So she wants to feel confident, so she’ll add a bit of that eyeshadow, maybe she’ll wear a dress because she likes the coulour,(I’m Canadian, so I’m going to spell it with a U) but that does not, make her brain any less than a man’s. In fact, those qualities just make her bold, daring. It’s like deciphering someone’s character from how they play sports. The person who always follows the rules to a T, you know they’re a stickler for rules and will never compromise safety to win a game. This is the exact same! I hope you learned about how women are perceived in the role of coding, and how we should expand our platforms to make our voices be heard. “She wrote some code just on the paper itself, and she’s really somebody we point to in our heritage as our founder of computer science” - Megan Smith on Ada Lovelace.']\n",

Sustainability in coding. How does it work? I propose this: Sustainability refers to the minimization of resources, and using finite resources at an amount at which they can sustain themselves. How does coding apply to this rule? Coding can be more sustainable by allowing certain devices to control more of what they do, since more technology and electronics are required to meet more of our needs. So, the development of a feature in a technology that can do more would be an example of sustainability. While how many electronics and physically-held technologies are used may come down to the engineering of computers, the language of these computers that enables them to do what they can is what makes them sustainable. There are also many other factors that come into play, such as ergonomics,and fixed shelf- lives that are controlled by the designers of technologies, which is why changing code to be sustainable would be better, since you can’t exactly change the amount of  time code is able to exist. Well, those are my thoughts on combining the principals and meaning of sustainability in the environment to coding. Signing off, you know who made this post, do I really have to sign off?

There is this little something that has being going around my head lately, and I wanted to share it with you guys.', 'I’ve seen many people experience a lot of frustration while learning (anything in general), and sometimes that frustration leads them to give up.

Here are 4 tips I want to share with you on how to overcome frustration while learning to code (or anything else, really).', '1. Make analogies with real life', 'Learning new coding concepts can be hard, especially if it’s your first time. (Or if you’re just learning concepts but never really learn how to apply them). That’s why it can be really helpful to compare what you’re learning to something else you already know. For example, the very concept of learning to code can be compared to learning a language. Programming languages also have their own syntax rules and other characteristics that make them unique. Of course, it can be a little bit tricky trying to come up with analogies yourself for things you’re still trying to understand, so in this case I’d really recommend asking someone who knows more about the topic.', '2. Take a break.', 'A point comes in where you’re just not learning anymore, you’re not making progress. Time isn’t really productive anymore; you’re blocked. First of all, chill, it’s normal.

Look for a new perspective', 'Sometimes, no matter how much effort we put into it, we still can’t manage to fully understand some concepts. In these cases, another pair of eyes comes really useful.

Being a coder should be more than just “memorizing Syntax” or “the mindset of programming”, according to the Firehose Project, a website dedicated to coding and real-world application of coding. However, not all of the courses on CodeCademy offer this, which is why I would like to use this post to make a difference in the lives of teen coders, and to petition to introduce a course made specifically for teens that combines their knowledge with the outer world, and the world of coding. Part 2 will be here soon, this is just an introduction, as I’d like to see what you think of the idea, fellow coders! Comment below and include any feedback/questions/any concerns you may have at all, my ears are open and fingers are at the computer all day learning, so you’ll get your answer in just the tap of a few letters, soon. Thank you for reading my post and I hope you were able to learn my perspective on coding as a teen, and how this knowledge can be used to better the education of others in the community. I know that CodeCademy recently offered a program tailored to  post- secondary-level students, but there’s no whiff of innovation, collaboration, or any principals being introduced to appeal to high school students. So, volia this here is the result.']\n",

      "['I am a Registered Nurse and recently decided to expand my knowledge into the IT field. My love for technology started right after high school when I landed an internship in the local hospital’s Information Services department. It is something I had always wanted to do, but I also wanted involvement with patients and healthcare. That was way back in 2001 and I never thought I could work in both fields. That was until I discovered that nurses are recruited into healthcare IT. We even have a Master’s degree called Nursing Informatics.', 'I wanted to go the informatics route, but the curricula are somewhat lacking. They teach what information we are getting and why it is beneficial, but they do not explain how to get it. So, I have decided to enroll into the CodeCademy and go the Data Science path.', 'It would be great if I could land a job with a degree in nursing and some coding skills. However, I also think it would be a great tool to have while studying for Nursing Informatics. I would love to hear from anyone else in the healthcare field. Has this helped at all? What are the job prospects?', 'I believe the Epic Electronic Health Record is built with a programming language called MUMPS(or M) and SQL.

Codecademy gets you off to a great start, and you can learn a lot, but doesn’t have everything yet.I’m not interested in a degree in coding. Is that available? Maybe I should check out some schools in my area to see if they have anything like that. I meant I would like to see if I can get a job with just my nursing degree. A position such as an informatics nurse or even a developer at a software company that works on Electronic Health Record software. I mentioned Epic and I believe they have the leading EHR in hospital systems.', 'So, I want to work on coding skills in my free time. I’m not interested in a degree. I would, however, be interested in working on a Master’s in Nursing Informatics in the future, but I want to see if I can get a job in the field before working on it.I’m really kind of open about which direction my career goes in. I’m not dead set on anything specific. I think my preference would be something within a hospital system and I think Nursing Informatics is the best option for that. I’m open to anything though. It would be interesting to see if EHR companies hire healthcare professionals. I think there are some translation problems between what the creators think we need and what the healthcare team actually needs.Well, you can learn the basics here on Codecademy by being a free member, and learn additionally with Pro and Pro intensives.Hi there. I work In IT (infrastructure) at a healthcare company where data science is a crucial component of what we’re trying to do: attempting to prove health outcomes for patients at our client practices. We have plenty of clinical staff who work on projects with the data scientists, and while everybody seems to work well together, I imagine the clinical staff would love having somebody like you, with interest in both fields, involved in those conversations ! We don’t use epic, rather NextGen. I’m not sure how much dev or coding the NextGen analyst performs, due to the fact that NextGen itself  provides this service for us. But if we had somebody who knew coding and also had extensive knowledge of the needs of clinicians in the field, I imagine that person would be valued greatly!', 'Anyway, the point is that there are definitely opportunities in this area (Philadelphia), and I imagine there will only be more and more as Healthcare changes (hopefully for the better…).', '-NickThat sounds like a really amazing job. I don’t think many people outside of healthcare would understand why, so I can see why they would hire them. Everything we do in healthcare is based on evidence. On top of that, healthcare organizations are paid based on patient outcomes. I could see a huge demand for a service like yours because it would create a higher payment rate.', 'You actually helped me out a little. There is something that had been bugging me for a while. I could never really figure out how the information goes from research to practice. We have a Quality team that gathers data and tells us what the best Evidence-Based Practice(EBP) is. However, I never really figured out where they are sending the data to or where they get the  EBP from. You guys must be the somewhere at the top of the ladder.', 'BTW I used to live in NJ and would visit my brother in Philly on the weekends. My favorite place for cheesesteaks was Tony Luke’s.This is partly how I am feeling right now. I am a nursing student and the EHR’s for my clinical rotations are, sorry to say, garbage.I can’t believe it has been over a year since I started this program. Last year I got through most of the Data Science program, but life got in the way. There were some disruptions, but I got it back together by around January of this year. I’m officially enrolled in a program for a Masters in Nursing Informatics and decided to come back to Codecademy. I see a lot of good changes around here and I’m excited to be back. I started the Data Science program again from the beginning and it’s coming back very easily. I’m looking forward to the curriculum and maybe one day soon start on some projects or a portfolio with you guys.It’s been about 3 months since you replied but I wasn’t around. What kind of program are you in? I finished up my BSN recently and enrolled in an MSN program this year. I have about 8 years of experience, so feel free to ask any questions.', 'I don’t miss nursing school at all lol. That was a stressful time in my life and I gained about 50 pounds.Yes, companies hire healthcare professionals to do different things. Our Chief Clinical Officer is a former RN, we don’t have any in our dev team at the moment.', 'Data Science is a way to go, but it’s very hard to give you proper advise because EHRs use different technologies. You may finish Codecademy’s course but that doesn’t guarantee you’re getting a job because while you’ll know how to analyze data, the EHR or hospital you want to work for might be using something other than Python. I’ve never heard of MUMPS before, then again I’ve only been working in healthcare for 2 years. Analyzing data is a great skill but EHR features are built more on how much revenue they can produce rather than how useful they can be. Data Science is not easy, it can be very useful but only when done properly (I haven’t seen that).', 'If you want to be a dev resource in a hospital, I suggest you learn how to write APIs. We use Typescript, Express and Node for that, but we also work with the FHIR standard. Regardless of the EHR you’re working with, FHIR defines the standards on how the data needs to be organized so it can be shared with different systems. You’ll also need database knowledge so take courses on SQL and noSQL (Mongo, MUMPS, etc.). AS a dev resource in healthcare, you’ll be more valuable with this knowledge as it’ll be needed regardless of the UI interface.', 'I feel like our profiles need an option for a signature, this would be mine: You need to be flexible. Just because you learned 1 language doesn’t that everything can be done in said language, if you only learn 1 language and don’t keep your mind open to new things you’re limiting your options for a job.Thanks for the advice. It’s great to hear from anyone with some insight into healthcare. Although true that you only have 2 years experience, but believe me, you just answered a lot of questions that I haven’t been able to find anywhere else.', 'I have about a year and a half to finish my informatics program. I had already studied for and passed an exam for the COMPTIA IT Fundamentals. It’s basically a useless cert, but I wanted something on my resume to show that I’m committed to this. Since last year and up until starting grad school, I’ve been thinking how to get into this field. My thoughts were that I’ll study Python and SQL, then build a portfolio full of little projects that I can show off. Maybe even make a website that I can link to my resume and make it interactive to try and impress future employers.', 'I have been considering what you said about APIs and healthcare specific technologies and I believe you’re right. I don’t think Python/SQL will land me a job so I think it’s something I’ll just show off on a portfolio and tack onto my resume. I was thinking that by the end of my program, I’ll start looking at specific companies or healthcare systems, and browse through their job posts. Hopefully I’ll find something I like, maybe a data analyst, and see what skills they’re looking for. I’ll start learning those skills, maybe take a few classes after graduation, and hopefully bring something to the table if I’m given an interview.COMP TIA is only useful when applying for IT Support jobs, other than that I haven’t seen a need for it. My sister uses EPIC at work, I’ve played with it but I don’t know what was used to build it. It’s very hard to find that kind of information unless you talk to someone who works there. Browsing for jobs will give you an idea, but technologies are always changing.There are many nursing programming IT jobs available now. Numerous schools are utilizing online medical software for school nurses to improve student health records. These school medical software like the one which I utilized in my school named EduHealth, assists with gathering, tracking and managing information of the student’s health in an effective manner. It is a great chance if you get into such a field.']\n",

Rather than just getting the checkmark on each lesson and moving on, use the code editor in the lessons to experiment with questions you might have. We’ll teach you the syntax that is correct, but you can do a lot more on your own. For example, if you’re working through a lesson on lists, we might teach you how to get a subset of that list using something like my_list[2:4]. Well, what happens if you do my_list[2:]? What about my_list[:4]? What about my_list[:-2]? How about my_list[4:2]? You can do small little experiments like that in your code editor rather than just doing my_list[2:4] and moving on - then when you come across a code challenge that involves getting a subset of a list, not only do you have more practice using that syntax, but you’ve also seen a few different edge cases.', '', 'Break the problems into pseudocode. Write down the solution in English and don’t even worry about the code. This will help develop those computational thinking skills, which are honestly more important than the syntax.

Add the two items together. Append the result to the list. Repeat 3 times. Return the list”. You now have a plan of action and can start writing code.', '', 'Start implementing the solution in code in parts. Don’t worry about getting the exact solution right away. Prove to yourself that you can do the building blocks of the solution. For example, in the Append Sum challenge, first prove to yourself that you can print the last item and second to last item in the list. Then prove to yourself that you can add those together by printing out that sum before even trying to add it to the list. If you feel shaky about adding an item to a list, forget about adding the sum of the last 2 items, just try adding something like \"test\" or 1.

What do you think?Sounds like you should focus on front end development, CSS is very important. Not only to make the app look nice, but you need to manage it efficiently in the code. Not all companies have a designer, let alone a good one. You can supplement that deficit, to an extent.You’re totally right. Thank you for helping me think through this!

      "['I’ve completed the Data Science and Computer Science career paths and have now moved on to the Web Dev path. I’ve been surprised by how much tougher the Web Dev path is than the other two. Specifically, once I got to module 10 (React) there seemed to be a pretty steep increase in difficulty. Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if it is just me, maybe web dev just doesn’t click with me as much.', 'Obviously there is nothing wrong with it being difficult as programming is a difficult subject in general, but again just caught off guard by how it differs from the other paths and wondering if it is just the nature of the path/web development in general or if it may be something on my end.I haven’t done the full Web Dev path, but I did the JavaScript Back-End Development and it was difficult. I spent a lot of time reading documentation and code trying to understand how to do the projects and even some of the lessons. I also think it’s a little strange that they put front-end development before back-end in the career path. I would think front-end would be easier to grasp with a foundation of back-end.I have been doing the Web Dev path for a few weeks now. I have been working hard on it and doing as many of the modules that I can. I feel like I have learned a lot, but I have no real world knowledge of how I would implement what I have learned into a project of my own. Following the steps is fairly simple, but learning to use what I have learned on my own has proven to be far more difficult.Implementing the skills outside of the projects in the course seems to be the most daunting thing. I’ve only been doing this course for about 10 days and from what I’ve seen so far, it holds your hand a lot in the projects.', 'So I’ve started to try and re-create them by myself. From scratch. It takes much longer at times, but I get much more out of it, because it’s not just about following instructions anymore, but figuring out stuff for yourself. It doesn’t have to be perfect or a huge project. Start out small, mess around with it, build on it. It’s terrifying, but will get easier with time (I hope). ', 'Good luck!Once you get to around module 10 of the course it starts holding your hand a lot less. I think that’s what is making it seem so tough. Some of the later projects are really rough in terms of figuring out what they are looking for and how to implement it. But as you say, hopefully you get more out of it that way and it will become easier with time.I figured as much. But I guess it’s one of those “learn how to swim or drown” things. That’s why I’m trying to mess around with everything I learn from the beginning so I’m ready to tackle the harder stuff when it comes around. Also: Google is your friend.  It might not help you figure out what the exercise wants from you, but it might help finding what you don’t get a grip on and give you an aha-moment or two.', 'Good luck!I can confirm that it does hold your hand less the further you go in. But, it got the a point to where I understood the code when reading it, but had no idea how to finish a challenge without a hint. The Node JS section completely lost me. It got to a point where I couldn’t progress further without just running the solution code. I ended up putting the rest of the course on hold until I feel more comfortable with the courses content.One additional thing I’ll note is that when you get to module 13, the X-Press Publishing cumulative project appears to contain several bugs/issues that make the project difficult to complete (ex. because the files you have to work with are old, you have to download an older version of NPM to work with them). I’ve noticed this kind of thing in a couple of other places in the course as well, which I think is adding to my frustration given what we are paying for our memberships.I am going through this now! How is/did everyone handle this change in difficulty/assistance? I find myself googling and watching YouTube videos a lot now to get a better understanding.', 'Anyone have any suggestions that they think helped them get through React modules and beyond?  I can’t wait for everyone’s feedback. Thanks in advance.I don’t suggest letting the modules be the only way you take in the information.', 'Documentation, youtube, irc/discord, note taking (written, visual, and audio), podcasts, and books are your best friends! Personally I find reference books go a long way, and some good ones can be accessed through subscription services (scribd, packt). I often just buy one if I really need to know the subject well, as they can cover a lot of grey areas (though you have to check through forums that you’re getting a really solid book).Yes, I recently completed the web developer path, and it got WAAAY harder once getting to Express and Node especially. Gratingly so… I got through it, but had to look at solutions a lot and kept wondering why it was so much less enjoyable than the preceding parts. Coding in general is fun, but Express??? Ugh. JS testing was pretty difficult too, but with the help of Google it went okay.', 'As some mentioned above, the projects to do off platform are also hindered by the fact that they use old versions of the packages. My computer wouldn’t even load them it just froze every time I tried to npm install for a X-press or expresso, beat-mix, and a few of the others (these may not all be in web dev, I jumped around a bit).', 'Having everything server heavy in the end of the course definitely slowed down progress and demotivated me a bit, but by then you are so close, it’s worth it to keep going! I agree, try to find other projects to do that help you to progress. Sometimes it helps to go back over the basics. for me reviewing apis, and dom events has proved very helpful to me. There are a lot of websites with front end challenges if you don’t know what to make. Sometimes reading what other people’s code helps you too because as you try to understand it you look up things as to why certain things run the way they doI finished the Webdev path last week. I have mixed feelings about it. Although I learned a lot during that course, some parts were very frustrating. I think the course needs a tiny overhaul. X-Press Publishing is the best example for it since it is buggy from the start on. I also remember the Loadash project that left me with a ‘WTF did I just learned and why’ feeling. The React course was great and also a bit frustrating. But I was so enthusiastic about React that I started learning it on Youtube. Thanks to Codevolution and other people I learned all about Hooks, Bootsrap React, React Spring, Axios … and btw. about using the spread operator (why not here?).', 'And this brings me to my suggestion of the day: I really like the approach from Codecademy to teach people these kind of thinks. But maybe you can connect some parts of the path like creating a website, using Git to publish it, using React and API calls (with MongoDB or the public Instagram API) to end up with a really cool “About Me” website. And every once in a while you have a look on some parts of the course because the world of coding develops fast.', 'And if the Webdev path has a Product Owner: Think about getting feedback from the people after each chapter. A star rating would already do it and I’m pretty sure a lot of people would like to give more feedback.

', 'Tell us a little about yourself.', 'Hi! I’m Carolyn, and I’m a backend software engineer at Codecademy. I’ve been a software engineer for almost three years now. Before that, I had a job as a coding teacher for a short while as well as some research positions in the natural history/molecular biology fields. Normally I live in Brooklyn, but since quarantine started I have been spending some time with my family in Northern California, where I grew up.', 'How did you end up working for Codecademy?', 'I was first introduced to coding in university, but would often meet other students who had been coding since they were young children––this was so intimidating to me at first and made me feel uncertain about whether or not coding was for me. It also made me keenly aware of the fact that even though I eventually came to really love coding, some people have a huge head start and yet many others don’t realize how it can benefit their career until much later on.', 'After university, I worked at a natural history museum, and among other things helped develop and teach a coding program aimed at high school girls. After I transitioned into a software engineering career, I remained interested in helping more people get into coding, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. I think platforms like Codecademy are a great way to increase access to a coding education to anyone who is interested.', 'Did you always want to be a backend software engineer?', 'No- I originally went to school to study molecular biology, with the intent of going into the healthcare field, and turns out there are some super cool applications of coding and data science in biological research as well. In the end, I think being in software has its advantages in that you can immediately have an impact and rapidly iterate on features and products in a way that you can’t always do in a research lab- but I still love to nerd out about genetics and evolution whenever I can.', 'What are the best aspects about working as a backend software engineer?', 'The problems are complex and interesting- I like that working in the backend allows me to envision a big picture of how parts of a system should work. the more experience I get, the more I learn all of the different ways to approach and solve a problem and all of the different tradeoffs. it’s like solving a bunch of different big and small puzzles all at once, which is fun and challenging!', 'another good thing that I think isn’t always talked about but is important to acknowledge is that working as a software engineer provides a lot of stability and flexibility in my life. I feel lucky that I get to solve interesting problems on a day to day basis as part of my job, but there are other things in my life that are important to me besides coding, and working as an engineer has allowed me to support myself and my loved ones while also allowing me time to focus on other things I enjoy in life as well.', 'What are the worst aspects about working as a backend software engineer?', 'As a backend engineer, your accomplishments are often less visible to your users and harder to explain to friends and family outside of tech- when you work on the front end elements of a site, it’s a lot easier to point to something on a webpage and say “look! I built this!”. A lot of the backend work is just as essential in building complex websites but harder to explain and get feedback on.', 'Also I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing, but in this field, I think it’s very common to feel unsatisfied and uncertain about your technical knowledge and expertise, no matter how many years you’ve been doing this for.

There are so many cool applications of coding to solving problems in biology, and some of them can get pretty complex, like reconstructing evolutionary history from DNA or predicting drug interactions.

This often involves writing code, but also could mean digging into our codebase to investigate a bug or to research the best way to implement something, talking to product managers or other engineers over slack to clarify requirements or understand a feature better, or reviewing code and technical documents written by my teammates.', 'When I’m done with work or taking a break, I do my best to focus on other things entirely- whether that be taking my dogs for a walk, trying out a new recipe (I’ve definitely gotten a lot more experimental with my cooking during quarantine), playing animal crossing on my switch, or video chatting with family and friends.', 'Great post.

Projects run by experienced TS devs that start with TS often have very strict usage, but if you’re not particularly TS experienced and/or your project isn’t already converted, there are looser compiler settings that allow less strictly typed code while still giving you most of the benefits. The Webpack codebase, for example, is actually deliberately still written in JavaScript (and last I checked plans on staying that way), but uses TypeScript as an extra layer of safety.', 'If you’re just getting started with JavaScript, or your project isn’t bigger than a few files, TypeScript might not be a great match for you.

To an extent, that statement is correct but a QA mindset is very different than a developer mindset.', 'Why? We find bugs in the code by testing the functionality, manually using the app.', 'How?

Just because you know Python doesn’t mean you can use it for every single automation project. Some apps benefit from automation in Python, others from Javascript, others in Ruby. As a QA Engineer, you need to be flexible and adaptable. You need to be able to pick up a new language when required. You don’t have to master it, but you need to be able to pick it up with little effort in a reasonable amount of time.', 'Once you enter the coding world, deadlines are constantly changing and everything is important so your manager is always going to push you to get things done quickly.

At first, Jake didn’t have plans to be a software engineer but with a strong interest in electronics, encouragement from peers, and a lot of perseverance, Jake now finds himself 11 years into a rewarding and fulfilling career as a Software Engineer.', 'Meet Jake! ', 'Tell us a little about yourself.', 'Hi, I’m Jake! I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for 11 years, and I’ve spent the last 5 years as a Front-end Engineer at Codecademy. I’m originally from Philadelphia, and now I live in the New Jersey suburbs, about a 45-minute train ride away from the Codecademy Office in NYC. I went to school for Graphic Design, and my first job was as a Web Designer. While I was there I started to learn Front-end development, and I was hooked immediately. I transitioned to working as an engineer full time and haven’t looked back.', 'How did you end up working for Codecademy?', 'In 2011 when Codecademy was launched, I was still learning how to code at my first job, so I created an account and tried it out pretty much immediately. I’m primarily a visual learner, so having an interactive way to learn to code online seemed like a perfect product for me at the time. The fact that Codecademy was trying to teach people in a way that resonated with me personally definitely stuck with me a few years later when I got the opportunity to interview at Codecademy.', 'Did you always want to be a Staff Software Engineer?', 'As a kid I always loved electronics, video games, and tinkering with all kinds of hardware and software, but I didn’t consider turning those hobbies into a career until after School. I was never a strong math student, and even though I spent a lot of time working with computers, the idea that I could be a software engineer never really seemed possible to me. Even when I got started building websites at my first job, it took me a long time to accept that I could do it. I was lucky to have mentors and friends at the company who saw that I had potential and encouraged me.', 'As far as being a Staff Engineer, I don’t think I really knew that role existed until I got my first job at a bigger company. The Engineers with the Staff title there were some of the most knowledgeable on the team, they were the engineers you were told to ask if you had a question on a certain topic, and they were always the ones you wanted constructive criticism from when you were writing a technical plan for a project. They would have that extra bit of context on the architecture of the site that could help you steer your project in the right direction.', 'I think having positive experiences with that role early in my career led me to aspire to take on that role when I gained more experience. Titles and responsibilities are all very different between companies, so it’s hard to say this is what “Staff” means on every team, or if they even have that title, but I think there are similar expectations for knowledge sharing and mentorship on more senior members of any engineering team.', 'What are the best aspects about working as a Staff Software Engineer?', 'As a Staff Software Engineer, I get to work on a wide variety of projects, and collaborate with all of the different product and engineering teams across the company. I’ve always loved the problem solving aspect of programming, so getting to spend a lot of my time with the team helping to solve different problems is really the best part of the job for me. I also really enjoy working with some of the more junior members on the team and helping them grow however I can. I try to welcome teammates to ask questions and propose solutions that might contradict my own view. Regardless of where someone is in their career I always feel like there’s something to learn from someone, often much more than you think.', 'What are the worst aspects about working as a Staff Software Engineer?', 'Dealing with ambiguity. Especially working on an engineering-driven team, I’m often being asked to figure out what the problems are AND propose solutions to them. It’s difficult to know where to start, and then, even if you know what to do, whether to prioritize that project over a thousand other things you know need to get done eventually. I’ve found that I always need to find collaborators on the team that I work well with and trust to bounce ideas off of and give me the extra confidence to make decisions.', 'If you could make one piece of fictional tech reality, what would it be?', 'Wow, there are so many things. It would be too safe to pick something that would solve world hunger or reverse global warming, so I’ll pick something fun. It’s so common in sci-fi movies that I barely notice it anymore, but I’ve always loved the idea of the personal spaceship. Having a small ship in the backyard ready to take me literally anywhere in the universe whenever I want seems like an amazing amount of freedom.', 'Do you have any advice for the learners?', 'My main advice is to not give up. Engineers at every level get stuck constantly. The lightbulb moment when you feel defeated and finally “get it” is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an engineer.', 'If you could make one brand new course what would it be?', 'I would make something simple and visually oriented that gets people that maybe don’t think they have the aptitude to become an engineer to see how so many of the skills they already have apply to engineering. I love when we put out courses on more complex technologies and new languages, but what really interests me is getting new people excited about coding.', 'What does a typical day look like for you?', 'I loved working in the office, but I’ve been working from home one or two days a week for the last few years.
